"That's an interesting application of write mode 2," you may well say,
"but is it really useful?" While the ability to convert chunky bitmaps
into VGA bitmaps does have its uses, Listing 27.1 is primarily intended
to illustrate the mechanics of write mode 2.

> ![](images/i.jpg)
> For performance, it's best to store 16-color bitmaps in pre-separated
> four-plane format in system memory, and copy one plane at a time to the
> screen. Ideally, such bitmaps should be copied one scan line at a time,
> with all four planes completed for one scan line before moving on to the
> next. I say this because when entire images are copied one plane at a
> time, nasty transient color effects can occur as one plane becomes
> visibly changed before other planes have been modified.

#### Drawing Color-Patterned Lines Using Write Mode 2 {#Heading6}

A more serviceable use of write mode 2 is shown in the program presented
in Listing 27.2. The program draws multicolored horizontal, vertical,
and diagonal lines, basing the color patterns on passed color tables.
Write mode 2 is ideal because in this application color can vary from
one pixel to the next, and in write mode 2 all that's required to set
pixel color is a change of the lower nibble of the byte written by the
CPU. Set/reset could be used to achieve the same result, but an
index/data pair of **OUT**s would be required to set the Set/Reset
register to each new color. Similarly, the Map Mask register could be
used in write mode 0 to set pixel color, but in this case not only would
an index/data pair of **OUT**s be required but there would also be no
guarantee that data already in display memory wouldn't interfere with
the color of the pixel being drawn, since the Map Mask register allows
only selected planes to be drawn to.

Listing 27.2 is hardly a comprehensive line drawing program. It draws
only a few special line cases, and although it is reasonably fast, it is
far from the fastest possible code to handle those cases, because it
goes through a dot-plot routine and because it draws horizontal lines a
pixel rather than a byte at a time. Write mode 2 would, however, serve
just as well in a full-blown line drawing routine. For any type of
patterned line drawing on the VGA, the basic approach remains the same:
Use the bit mask to select the pixel (or pixels) to be altered and use
the CPU byte in write mode 2 to select the color in which to draw.
