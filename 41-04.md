**LISTING 41.4 L41-4.C**

    /* Color-fills an arbitrarily-shaped polygon described by VertexList.
    If the first and last points in VertexList are not the same, the path
    around the polygon is automatically closed. All vertices are offset
    by (XOffset, YOffset). Returns 1 for success, 0 if memory allocation
    failed. All C code tested with Borland C++.

    If the polygon shape is known in advance, speedier processing may be
    enabled by specifying the shape as follows: "convex" - a rubber band
    stretched around the polygon would touch every vertex in order;
    "nonconvex" - the polygon is not self-intersecting, but need not be
    convex; "complex" - the polygon may be self-intersecting, or, indeed,
    any sort of polygon at all. Complex will work for all polygons; convex
    is fastest. Undefined results will occur if convex is specified for a
    nonconvex or complex polygon.

    Define CONVEX_CODE_LINKED if the fast convex polygon filling code from
    the February 1991 column is linked in. Otherwise, convex polygons are
    handled by the complex polygon filling code.
    Nonconvex is handled as complex in this implementation. See text for a
    discussion of faster nonconvex handling. */

Is monotone-vertical polygon detection worth all this trouble? Under the
right circumstances, you bet. In a situation where a great many polygons
are being drawn, and the application either doesn't know whether they're
monotone-vertical or has no way to tell the polygon filler that they
are, performance can be increased considerably if most polygons are, in
fact, monotone-vertical. This potential performance advantage is helped
along by the surprising fact that Jim's test for monotone-vertical
status is simpler and faster than my original, nonfunctional test for
convexity.

See what accurate terminology and effective communication can do?
