**LISTING 35.3 L35-3.ASM**

    ; Fast assembler implementation of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm
    ; for the EGA and VGA. Works in modes 0Eh, 0Fh, 10h, and 12h.
    ; Borland C++ near-callable.
    ; Bit mask accumulation technique when |DeltaX| >= |DeltaY|
    ;  suggested by Jim Mackraz.
    ;
    ; Assembled with TASM

An explanation of the workings of the code in Listing 35.3 would be a
lengthy one, and would be redundant since the basic operation of the
code in Listing 35.3 is no different from that of the code in Listing
35.1, although the implementation is much changed due to the nature of
assembly language and also due to designing for speed rather than for
clarity. Given that you thoroughly understand the C implementation in
Listing 35.1, the assembly language implementation in Listing 35.3,
which is well-commented, should speak for itself.

One point I do want to make is that Listing 35.3 incorporates a clever
notion for which credit is due Jim Mackraz, who described the notion in
a letter written in response to an article I wrote long ago in the late
and lamented *Programmer's Journal*. Jim's suggestion was that when
drawing lines for which |**DeltaX**| is greater than |**DeltaY**|, bits
set to 1 for each of the pixels controlled by a given byte can be
accumulated in a register, rather than drawing each pixel individually.
All the pixels controlled by that byte can then be drawn at once, with a
single access to display memory, when all pixel processing associated
with that byte has been completed. This approach can save many **OUT**s
and many display memory reads and writes when drawing nearly-horizontal
lines, and that's important because EGAs and VGAs hold the CPU up for a
considerable period of time on each I/O operation and display memory
access.

All too many PC programmers fall into the high-level-language trap of
thinking that a good algorithm guarantees good performance. Not so: As
our two implementations of Bresenham's algorithm graphically illustrate
(pun not originally intended, but allowed to stand once recognized),
truly great PC code requires both a good algorithm *and* a good assembly
implementation. In Listing 35.3, we've got y-oh-my, isn't it fun?
