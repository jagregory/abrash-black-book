## Chapter 39 -- Fast Convex Polygons

### Filling Polygons in a Hurry

In the previous chapter, we explored the surprisingly intricate process
of filling convex polygons. Now we're going to fill them an order of
magnitude or so faster.

Two thoughts may occur to some of you at this point: "Oh, no, he's not
going to get into assembly language and device-dependent code, is he?"
and, "Why bother with polygon filling—or, indeed, any drawing
primitives—anyway? Isn't that what GUIs and third-party libraries are
for?"

To which I answer, "Well, yes, I am," and, "If you have to ask, you've
missed the magic of microcomputer programming." Actually, both questions
ask the same thing, and that is: "Why should I, as a programmer, have
any idea how my program actually works?"

Put that way, it sounds a little different, doesn't it?

GUIs, reusable code, portable code written entirely in high-level
languages, and object-oriented programming are all the rage now, and
promise to remain so for the foreseeable future. The thrust of this
technology is to enhance the software development process by offloading
as much responsibility as possible to other programmers, and by writing
all remaining code in modular, generic form. This modular code then
becomes a black box to be reused endlessly without another thought about
what actually lies inside. GUIs also reduce development time by making
many interface choices for you. That, in turn, makes it possible to
create quickly and reliably programs that will be easy for new users to
pick up, so software becomes easier to both produce and learn. This is,
without question, a Good Thing.

The "black box" approach does not, however, necessarily cause the
software itself to become faster, smaller, or more innovative; quite the
opposite, I suspect. I'll reserve judgement on whether that is a good
thing or not, but I'll make a prediction: In the short run, the
aforementioned techniques will lead to noticeably larger, slower
programs, as programmers understand less and less of what the key parts
of their programs do and rely increasingly on general-purpose code
written by other people. (In the long run, programs will be bigger and
slower yet, but computers will be so fast and will have so much memory
that no one will care.) Over time, PC programs will also come to be more
similar to one another—and to programs running on other platforms, such
as the Mac—as regards both user interface and performance.

Again, I am not saying that this is bad. It does, however, have major
implications for the future nature of PC graphics programming, in ways
that will directly affect the means by which many of you earn your
livings. Not so very long from now, graphics programming—all
programming, for that matter—will become mostly a matter of assembling
in various ways components written by other people, and will cease to be
the all-inclusively creative, mindbendingly complex pursuit it is today.
(Using legally certified black boxes is, by the way, one direction in
which the patent lawyers are leading us; legal considerations may be the
final nail in the coffin of homegrown code.) For now, though, it's still
within your power, as a PC programmer, to understand and even control
every single thing that happens on a computer if you so desire, to
realize any vision you may have. Take advantage of this unique window of
opportunity to create some magic!

Neither does it hurt to understand what's involved in drawing, say, a
filled polygon, even if you are using a GUI. You will better understand
the performance implications of the available GUI functions, and you
will be able to fill in any gaps in the functions provided. You may even
find that you can outperform the GUI on occasion by doing your own
drawing into a system memory bitmap, then copying the result to the
screen; for instance, you can do this under Windows by using the WinG
library available from Microsoft. You will also be able to understand
why various quirks exist, and will be able to put them to good use. For
example, the X Window System follows the polygon drawing rules described
in the previous chapter (although it's not obvious from the X Window
System documentation); if you understood the previous chapter's
discussion, you're in good shape to use polygons under X.

In short, even though doing so runs counter to current trends, it helps
to understand how things work, especially when they're very visible
parts of the software you develop. That said, let's learn more about
filling convex polygons.

### Fast Convex Polygon Filling

In addressing the topic of filling convex polygons in the previous
chapter, the implementation we came up with met all of our functional
requirements. In particular, it met stringent rules that guaranteed that
polygons would never overlap or have gaps at shared edges, an important
consideration when building polygon-based images. Unfortunately, the
implementation was also slow as molasses. In this chapter we'll work up
polygon-filling code that's fast enough to be truly usable.

Our original polygon filling code involved three major tasks, each
performed by a separate function:

  * Tracing each polygon edge to generate a coordinate list (performed
    by the function `ScanEdge`);
  * Drawing the scanned-out horizontal lines that constitute the filled
    polygon (`DrawHorizontalLineList`); and
  * Characterizing the polygon and coordinating the tracing and drawing
    (`FillConvexPolygon`).

The amount of time that the previous chapter's sample program spent in
each of these areas is shown in Table 39.1. As you can see, half the
time was spent drawing and the other half was spent tracing the polygon
edges (the time spent in `FillConvexPolygon` was relatively
minuscule), so we have our choice of where to begin optimizing.

#### Fast Drawing

Let's start with drawing, which is easily sped up. The previous
chapter's code used a double-nested loop that called a draw-pixel
function to plot each pixel in the polygon individually. That's a
ridiculous approach in a graphics mode that offers linearly mapped
memory, as does VGA mode 13H, the mode in which we're working. At the
very least, we could point a far pointer to the left edge of each
polygon scan line, then draw each pixel in that scan line in quick
succession, using something along the lines of `*ScrPtr++ =
FillColor;` inside a loop.

However, it seems silly to use a loop when the x86 has an instruction,
`REP STOS`, that's uniquely suited to filling linear memory buffers.
There's no way to use `REP STOS` directly in C code, but it's a good
bet that the `memset` library function uses `REP STOS`, so you could
greatly enhance performance by using `memset` to draw each scan line
of the polygon in a single shot. That, however, is easier said than
done. The `memset` function linked in from the library is tied to the
memory model in use; in small (which includes Tiny, Small, or Medium)
data models `memset` accepts only near pointers, so it can't be used
to access screen memory. Consequently, a large (which includes Compact,
Large, or Huge) data model must be used to allow `memset` to draw to
display memory—a clear case of the tail wagging the dog. This is an
excellent example of why, although it is possible to use C to do
virtually anything, it's sometimes much simpler just to use a little
assembly code and be done with it.

At any rate, Listing 39.1 for this chapter shows a version of
`DrawHorizontalLineList` that uses memset to draw each scan line of
the polygon in a single call. When linked to Chapter 38's test program,
Listing 39.1 increases pure drawing speed (disregarding edge tracing and
other nondrawing time) by more than an order of magnitude over Chapter
38's draw-pixel-based code, despite the fact that Listing 39.1 requires
a large (in this case, the Compact) data model. Listing 39.1 works fine
with Borland C++, but may not work with other compilers, for it relies
on the aforementioned interaction between memset and the selected memory
model.

All times are in seconds, as measured with Turbo Profiler on a 20-MHz
cached 386 with no math coprocessor installed. Note that time spent in
`main()` is not included. C code was compiled with Borland C++ with
maximum optimization (-G -O -Z -r -a); assembly language code was
assembled with TASM. Percentages of combined times are rounded to the
nearest percent, so the sum of the three percentages does not always
equal 100.

{

   int Length, Width;
   unsigned char far *ScreenPtr;

   /* Point to the start of the first scan line on which to draw */
   ScreenPtr = MK_FP(SCREEN_SEGMENT,
         HLineListPtr->YStart * SCREEN_WIDTH);

   /* Point to the XStart/XEnd descriptor for the first (top)

   HLinePtr = HLineListPtr->HLinePtr;
   /* Draw each horizontal line in turn, starting with the top one and
      advancing one line each time */
   Length = HLineListPtr->Length;
   while (Length-- > 0) {
      /* Draw the whole horizontal line if it has a positive width */
      if ((Width = HLinePtr->XEnd - HLinePtr->XStart + 1) > 0)
         memset(ScreenPtr + HLinePtr->XStart, Color, Width);
      HLinePtr++;                /* point to next scan line X info */
      ScreenPtr += SCREEN_WIDTH; /* point to next scan line start */
   }
}
```

At this point, I'd like to mention that benchmarks are notoriously
unreliable; the results in Table 39.1 are accurate *only* for the test
program, and only when running on a particular system. Results could be
vastly different if smaller, larger, or more complex polygons were
drawn, or if a faster or slower computer/VGA combination were used.
These factors notwithstanding, the test program does fill a variety of
polygons of varying complexity sized from large to small and in between,
and certainly the order of magnitude difference between Listing 39.1 and
the old version of `DrawHorizontalLineList` is a clear indication of
which code is superior.

Anyway, Listing 39.1 has the desired effect of vastly improving drawing
time. There are cycles yet to be had in the drawing code, but as tracing
polygon edges now takes 92 percent of the polygon filling time, it's
logical to optimize the tracing code next.

#### Fast Edge Tracing

There's no secret as to why last chapter's `ScanEdge` was so slow: It
used floating point calculations. One secret of fast graphics is using
integer or fixed-point calculations, instead. (Sure, the floating point
code would run faster if a math coprocessor were installed, but it would
still be slower than the alternatives; besides, why require a math
coprocessor when you don't have to?) Both integer and fixed-point
calculations are fast. In many cases, fixed-point is faster, but integer
calculations have one tremendous virtue: They're completely accurate.
The tiny imprecision inherent in either fixed or floating-point
calculations can result in occasional pixels being one position off from
their proper location. This is no great tragedy, but after going to so
much trouble to ensure that polygons don't overlap at common edges, why
not get it exactly right?

In fact, when I tested out the integer edge tracing code by comparing an
integer-based test image to one produced by floating-point calculations,
two pixels out of the whole screen differed, leading me to suspect a bug
in the integer code. It turned out, however, that's in those two cases,
the floating point results were sufficiently imprecise to creep from
just under an integer value to just over it, so that the `ceil`
function returned a coordinate that was one too large.

> ![](../images/i.jpg)
> Floating point is very accurate—but it is not precise. Integer
> calculations, properly performed, are.

Listing 39.2 shows a C implementation of integer edge tracing. Vertical
and diagonal lines, which are trivial to trace, are special-cased. Other
lines are broken into two categories: Y-major (closer to vertical) and
X-major (closer to horizontal). The handlers for the Y-major and X-major
cases operate on the principle of similar triangles: The number of X
pixels advanced per scan line is the same as the ratio of the X delta of
the edge to the Y delta. Listing 39.2 is more complex than the original
floating point implementation, but not painfully so. In return for that
complexity, Listing 39.2 is more than 80 times faster at scanning
edges—and, as just mentioned, it's actually more accurate than the
floating point code.

Ya gotta love that integer arithmetic.

**LISTING 39.2 L39-2.C**

/* Scan converts an edge from (X1,Y1) to (X2,Y2), not including the
   point at (X2,Y2). If SkipFirst == 1, the point at (X1,Y1) isn't
   drawn; if SkipFirst == 0, it is. For each scan line, the pixel
   closest to the scanned edge without being to the left of the
   scanned edge is chosen. Uses an all-integer approach for speed and
   precision. */

### The Finishing Touch: Assembly Language

The C implementation in Listing 39.2 is now nearly 20 times as fast as
the original, which is good enough for most purposes. Still, it requires
that one of the large data models be used (for `memset` ), and it's
certainly not the fastest possible code. The obvious next step is
assembly language.

Listing 39.3 is an assembly language version of
`DrawHorizontalLineList` . In actual use, it proved to be about 36
percent faster than Listing 39.1; better than a poke in the eye with a
sharp stick, but just barely. There's more to these timing results than
meets that eye, though. Display memory generally responds much more
slowly than system memory, especially in 386 and 486 systems. That means
that much of the time taken by Listing 39.3 is actually spent waiting
for display memory accesses to complete, with the processor forced to
idle by wait states. If, instead, Listing 39.3 drew to a local buffer in
system memory or to a particularly fast VGA, the assembly implementation
might well display a far more substantial advantage over the C code.

And indeed it does. When the test program is modified to draw to a local
buffer, both the C and assembly language versions get 0.29 seconds
faster, that being a measure of the time taken by display memory wait
states. With those wait states factored out, the assembly language
version of `DrawHorizontalLineList` becomes almost three times as fast
as the C code.

#### Maximizing REP STOS

Listing 39.3 doesn't take the easy way out and use `REP STOSB` to fill
each scan line; instead, it uses `REP STOSW` to fill as many pixel
pairs as possible via word-sized accesses, using `STOSB` only to do
odd bytes. Word accesses to odd addresses are always split by the
processor into 2-byte accesses. Such word accesses take twice as long as
word accesses to even addresses, so Listing 39.3 makes sure that all
word accesses occur at even addresses, by performing a leading `STOSB`
first if necessary.

Listing 39.3 is another case in which it's worth knowing the environment
in which your code will run. Extra code is required to perform aligned
word-at-a-time filling, resulting in extra overhead. For very small or
narrow polygons, that overhead might overwhelm the advantage of drawing
a word at a time, making plain old `REP STOSB` faster.

### Faster Edge Tracing

Finally, Listing 39.4 is an assembly language version of `ScanEdge`.
Listing 39.4 is a relatively straightforward translation from C to
assembly, but is nonetheless about twice as fast as Listing 39.2.

The version of `ScanEdge` in Listing 39.4 could certainly be sped up
still further by unrolling the loops. `FillConvexPolygon`, the overall
coordination routine, hasn't even been converted to assembly language,
so that could be sped up as well. I haven't bothered with these
optimizations because all code other than `DrawHorizontalLineList`
takes only 14 percent of the overall polygon filling time when drawing
to display memory; the potential return on optimizing nondrawing code
simply isn't great enough to justify the effort. Part of the value of a
profiler is being able to tell when to stop optimizing; with Listings
39.3 and 39.4 in use, more than two-thirds of the time taken to draw
polygons is spent waiting for display memory, so optimization is pretty
much maxed out. However, further optimization might be worthwhile when
drawing to system memory, where wait states are out of the picture and
the nondrawing code takes a significant portion (46 percent) of the
overall time.

Again, *know where the cycles go* .

By the way, note that all the versions of `ScanEdge` and
`FillConvexPolygon` that we've looked at are adapter-independent, and
that the C code is also machine-independent; all adapter-specific code
is isolated in `DrawHorizontalLineList`. This makes it easy to add
support for other graphics systems, such as the 8514/A, the XGA, or, for
that matter, a completely non-PC system.
