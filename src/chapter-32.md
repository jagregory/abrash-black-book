## Chapter 32 -- Be It Resolved: 360x480

### Taking 256-Color Modes About as Far as the Standard VGA Can Take Them

In the last chapter, we learned how to coax 320x400 256-color resolution
out of a standard VGA. At the time, I noted that the VGA was actually
capable of supporting 256-color resolutions as high as 360x480, but
didn't pursue the topic further, preferring to concentrate on the
versatile and easy-to-set 320x400 256-color mode instead.

Some time back I was sent a particularly useful item from John Bridges,
a longtime correspondent and an excellent programmer. It was a complete
mode set routine for 360x480 256-color mode that he has placed into the
public domain. In addition, John wrote, "I also have a couple of
freeware (free, but not public domain) utilities out there, including
PICEM, which displays PIC, PCX, and GIF images not only in 360x480x256
but also in 640x350x256, 640x400x256, 640x480x256, and 800x600x256 on
SuperVGAs."

In this chapter, I'm going to combine John's mode set code with
appropriately modified versions of the dot-plot code from Chapter 31 and
the line-drawing code that we'll develop in Chapter 35. Together, those
routines will make a pretty nifty demo of the capabilities of 360x480
256-color mode.

### Extended 256-Color Modes: What's Not to Like?

When last we left 256-color programming, we had found that the standard
256-color mode, mode 13H, which officially offers 320x200 resolution,
actually displays 400, not 200, scan lines, with line-doubling used to
reduce the effective resolution to 320x200. By tweaking a few of the
VGA's mode registers, we converted mode 13H to a true 320x400 256-color
mode. As an added bonus, that 320x400 mode supports two graphics pages,
a distinct improvement over the single graphics page supported by mode
13H. (We also learned how to get *four* graphics pages at 320x200
resolution, should that be needed.)

I particularly like 320x400 256-color mode for two reasons: It supports
two-page graphics, which is very important for animation applications;
and it doesn't require changing any of the monitor timing
characteristics of the VGA. The mode bits that we changed to produce
320x400 256-color mode are pretty much guaranteed to be the same from
one VGA to another, but the monitor-oriented registers are less certain
to be constant, especially for VGAs that provide special support for the
extended capabilities of various multiscanning monitors.

All in all, those are good arguments for 320x400 256-color mode.
However, the counter-argument seems compelling as well—nothing beats
higher resolution for producing striking graphics. Given that, and given
that John Bridges was kind enough to make his mode set code available,
I'm going to look at 360x480 256mode next. However, bear in mind that
the drawbacks of this mode are the flip side of the strengths of 320x400
256-color mode: Only one graphics page, and direct setting of the
monitorregisters. Also, this mode has a peculiar and unique aspect
ratio, with 480 pixels (as many as high-resolution mode 12H) vertically
and only 360 horizontally. That makes for fairly poor horizontal
resolution and sometimes-jagged drawing; on the other hand, the
resolution is better in both directions than in mode 13H, and mode 13H
itself has an odd aspect ratio, so it seems a bit petty to complain.

The single graphics page isn't a drawback if you don't need page
flipping, of course, so there's not much to worry about there: If you
need page flipping, don't use this mode. The direct setting of the
monitor-oriented registers is another matter altogether.

I don't know how likely this code is to produce problems with clone VGAs
in general; however, I did find that I had to put an older Video Seven
VRAM VGA into "pure" mode—where it treats the VRAMs as DRAMs and exactly
emulates a plain-vanilla IBM VGA—before 360x480 256-color mode would
work properly. Now, that particular problem was due to an inherent
characteristic of VRAMs, and shouldn't occur on Video Seven's Fastwrite
adapter or any other VGA clone. Nonetheless, 360x480 256-color mode is a
good deal different from any standard VGA mode, and while the code in
this chapter runs perfectly well on all other VGAs in my experience, I
can't guarantee its functionality on any particular VGA/monitor
combination, unlike 320x400 256-color mode. Mind you, 360x480 256-color
mode *should* work on all VGAs—there are just too many variables
involved for me to be certain. Feedback from readers with broad 360x480
256-color experience is welcome.

The above notwithstanding, 360x480 256-color mode offers 64 times as
many colors and nearly three times as many pixels as IBM's original CGA
color graphics mode, making startlingly realistic effects possible. No
mode of the VGA (at least no mode that I know of!), documented or
undocumented, offers a better combination of resolution and color; even
320x400 256-color mode has 26 percent fewer pixels.

In other words, 360x480 256-color mode is worth considering—so let's
have a look.

### 360x480 256-Color Mode

I'm going to start by showing you 360x480 256-color mode in action,
after which we'll look at how it works. I suspect that once you see what
this mode looks like, you'll be more than eager to learn how to use it.

Listing 32.1 contains three C-callable assembly functions. As you would
expect, `Set360x480Mode` places the VGA into 360x480 256mode.
`Draw360x480Dot` draws a pixel of the specified color at the specified
location. Finally, `Read360x480Dot` returns the color of the pixel at
the specified location. (This last function isn't actually used in the
example program in this chapter, but is included for completeness.)

Listing 32.2 contains an adaptation of some C linecode I'll be
presenting shortly in Chapter 35. If you're reading this book in serial
fashion and haven't gotten there yet, simply take it on faith. If you
really *really* need to know how the line-draw code works right *now*,
by all means make a short forward call to Chapter 35 and digest it. The
line-draw code presented below has been altered to select 360x480
256-color mode, and to cycle through all 256 colors that this mode
supports, drawing each line in a different color.

The first thing you'll notice when you run this code is that the speed
of 360x480 256-color mode is pretty good, especially considering that
most of the program is im-plemented in C.

The second thing you'll notice is that exquisite shading effects are
possible in 360x480 256-color mode; adjacent lines blend together
remarkably smoothly, even with the default palette. The VGA allows you
to select your 256 colors from a palette of 256K, so you could, if you
wished, set up the colors to produce still finer shading albeit with
fewer distinctly different colors available. For more on this and
related topics, see the coverage of palette reprogramming that begins in
the next chapter.

The one thing you may not notice right away is just how much detail is
visible on the screen, because the blending of colors tends to obscure
the superior resolution of this mode. Each of the four rectangles
displayed measures 180 pixels horizontally by 240 vertically. Put
another way, each *one* of those rectangles has two-thirds as many
pixels as the entire mode 13H screen; in all, 360x480 256-color mode has
2.7 times as many pixels as mode 13H! As mentioned above, the resolution
is unevenly distributed, with vertical resolution matching that of mode
12H but horizontal resolution barely exceeding that of mode 13H—but
resolution is hot stuff, no matter how it's laid out, and 360x480
256-color mode has the highest 256-color resolution you're ever likely
to see on a standard VGA. (SuperVGAs are quite another matter—but when
you *require* a SuperVGA you're automatically excluding what might be a
significant chunk of the market for your code.)

Now that we've seen the wonders of which our new mode is capable, let's
take the time to understand how it works.

### How 360x480 256-Color Mode Works

In describing 360x480 256-color mode, I'm going to assume that you're
familiar with the discussion of 320x400 256-color mode in the last
chapter. If not, go back to that chapter and read it; the two modes have
a great deal in common, and I'm not going to bore you by repeating
myself when the goods are just a few page flips (the paper kind) away.

360x480 256-color mode is essentially 320x400 256-color mode, but
stretched in both dimensions. Let's look at the vertical stretching
first, since that's the simpler of the two.

#### 480 Scan Lines per Screen: A Little Slower, But No Big Deal

There's nothing unusual about 480 scan lines; standard modes 11H and 12H
support that vertical resolution. The number of scan lines has nothing
to do with either the number of colors or the horizontal resolution, so
converting 320x400 256mode to 320x480 256-color mode is a simple matter
of reprogramming the VGA's vertical control registers—which control the
scan lines displayed, the vertical sync pulse, vertical blanking, and
the total number of scan lines—to the 480-scansettings, and setting the
polarities of the horizontal and vertical sync pulses to tell the
monitor to adjust to a 480-line screen.

Switching to 480 scan lines has the effect of slowing the screen refresh
rate. The VGA always displays at 70 Hz *except* in 480-scan-line modes;
there, due to the time required to scan the extra lines, the refresh
rate slows to 60 Hz. (VGA monitors always scan at the same rate
horizontally; that is, the distance across the screen covered by the
electron beam in a given period of time is the same in all modes.
Consequently, adding extra lines per frame requires extra time.) 60 Hz
isn't *bad*—that's the only refresh rate the EGA ever supported, and the
EGA was the industry standard in its time—but it does tend to flicker a
little more and so is a little harder on the eyes than 70 Hz.

#### 360 Pixels per Scan Line: No Mean Feat

Converting from 320 to 360 pixels per scan line is more difficult than
converting from 400 to 480 scan lines per screen. None of the VGA's
graphics modes supports 360 pixels across the screen, or anything like
it; the standard choices are 320 and 640 pixels across. However, the VGA
*does* support the horizontal resolution we seek—360 pixels—in 40-column
*text* mode.

Unfortunately, the register settings that select those horizontal
resolutions aren't directly transferable to graphics mode. Text modes
display 9 dots (the width of one character) for each time information is
fetched from display memory, while graphics modes display just 4 or 8
dots per display memory fetch. (Although it's a bit confusing, it's
standard terminology to refer to the interval required for one display
memory fetch as a "character," and I'll follow that terminology from now
on.) Consequently, both modes display either 40 or 80 characters per
scan line; the only difference is that text modes display more pixels
per character. Given that graphics modes *can't* display 9 dots per
character (there's only enough information for eight 16pixels or four
256-color pixels in each memory fetch, and that's that), we'd seem to be
at an impasse.

The key to solving this problem lies in recalling that the VGA is
designed to drive a monitor that sweeps the electron beam across the
screen at exactly the same speed, no matter what mode the VGA is in. If
the monitor always sweeps at the same speed, how does the VGA manage to
display both 640 pixels across the screen (in high-resolution graphics
modes) and 720 pixels across the screen (in 80-column text modes)? Good
question indeed—and the answer is that the VGA has not one but *two*
clocks on board, and one of those clocks is just sufficiently faster
than the other clock so that an extra 80 (or 40) pixels can be displayed
on each scan line.

In other words, there's a slow clock (about 25 MHz) that's usually used
in graphics modes to get 640 (or 320) pixels on the screen during each
scan line, and a second, fast clock (about 28 MHz) that's usually used
in text modes to crank out 720 (or 360) pixels per scan line. In
particular, 320x400 256-color mode uses the 25 MHz clock.

I'll bet that you can see where I'm headed: We can switch from the 25
MHz clock to the 28 MHz clock in 320x480 256mode in order to get more
pixels. It takes two clocks to produce one 256-color pixel, so we'll get
40 rather than 80 extra pixels by doing this, bringing our horizontal
resolution to the desired 360 pixels.

Switching horizontal resolutions sounds easy, doesn't it? Alas, it's
not. There's no standard VGA mode that uses the 28 MHz clock to draw 8
rather than 9 dots per character, so the timing parameters have to be
calculated from scratch. John Bridges has already done that for us, but
I want you to appreciate that producing this mode took some work. The
registers controlling the total number of characters per scan line, the
number of characters displayed, the horizontal sync pulse, horizontal
blanking, the offset from the start of one line to the start of the
next, and the clock speed all have to be altered in order to set up
360x480 256-color mode. The function `Set360x480Mode` in Listing 32.1
does all that, and sets up the registers that control vertical
resolution, as well.

Once all that's done, the VGA is in 360x480 mode, awaiting our every
high-resolution 256-color graphics whim.

#### Accessing Display Memory in 360x480 256-Color Mode

Setting up for 360x480 256-color mode proved to be quite a task. Is
drawing in this mode going to be as difficult?

No. In fact, if you know how to draw in 320x400 256-color mode, you
already know how to draw in 360x480 256-color mode; the conversion
between the two is a simple matter of changing the working screen width
from 320 pixels to 360 pixels. In fact, if you were to take the 320x400
256-color pixel reading and pixel writing code from Chapter 31 and
change the `SCREEN_WIDTH` equate from 320 to 360, those routines
would work perfectly in 360x480 256-color mode.

The organization of display memory in 360x480 256-color mode is almost
exactly the same as in 320x400 256-color mode, which we covered in
detail in the last chapter. However, as a quick refresher, each byte of
display memory controls one 256-color pixel, just as in mode 13H. The
VGA is reprogrammed by the mode set so that adjacent pixels lie in
adjacent planes of display memory. Look back to Figure 31.1 in the last
chapter to see the organization of the first few pixels on the screen;
the bytes controlling those pixels run cross-plane, advancing to the
next address only every fourth pixel. The address of the pixel at screen
coordinate (*x,y*) is

*address* = ((*y*\*360)+*x*)/4

and the plane of a given pixel is:

*plane* = *x* modulo 4

A new scan line starts every 360 pixels, or 90 bytes, as shown in Figure
32.1. This is the major programming difference between the 360x480 and
320x400 256-color modes; in the 320x400 mode, a new scan line starts
every 80 bytes.

The other programming difference between the two modes is that the area
of display memory mapped to the screen is longer in 360x480 256-color
mode, which is only common sense given that there are more pixels in
that mode. The exact amount of memory required in 360x480 256-color mode
is 360 times 480 = 172,800 bytes. That's more than half of the VGA's 256
Kb memory complement, so page-flipping is out; however, there's no
reason you couldn't use that extra memory to create a virtual screen
larger than 360x480, around which you could then scroll, if you wish.

That's really all there is to drawing in 360x480 256-color mode. From a
programming perspective, this mode is no more complicated than 320x400
256-color mode once the mode set is completed, and should be capable of
good performance given some clever coding. It's not particular
straightforward to implement bitblt, block move, or fast line-drawing
code for any of the extended 256-color modes, but it can be done—and
it's worth the trouble. Even the small taste we've gotten of the
capabilities of these modes shows that they put the traditional CGA,
EGA, and generally even VGA modes to shame.

![**Figure 32.1**  *Pixel organization in 360x480 256-color mode.*](../images/32-01.jpg)

There's more and better to come, though; in later chapters, we'll return
to high-resolution 256-color programming in a big way, by exploring the
tremendous potential of these modes for real time 2-D and 3-D animation.
