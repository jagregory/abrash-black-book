## Chapter 45 -- Dog Hair and Dirty Rectangles

### Different Angles on Animation

We brought our pets with us when we moved to Seattle. At about the same
time, our Golden Retriever, Sam, observed his third birthday. Sam is
relatively intelligent, in the sense that he is clearly smarter than a
banana slug, although if he were in the same room with Jeff Duntemann's
dog Mr. Byte, there's a reasonable chance that he would mistake Mr. Byte
for something edible (a category that includes rocks, socks, and a
surprising number of things too disgusting to mention), and Jeff would
have to find a new source of things to write about.

But that's not important now. What is important is that—and I am not
making this up—this morning I managed to find the one pair of socks Sam
hadn't chewed holes in. And what's even more important is that after we
moved and Sam turned three, he calmed down amazingly. We had been
waiting for this magic transformation since Sam turned one, the age at
which most puppies turn into normal dogs who lie around a lot, waking up
to eat their Science Diet (motto, "The dog food that costs more than the
average neurosurgeon makes in a year") before licking themselves in
embarrassing places and going back to sleep. When Sam turned one and
remained hopelessly out of control we said, "Goldens take two years to
calm down," as if we had a clue. When he turned two and remained
undeniably Sam we said, "Any day now." By the time he turned three, we
were reduced to figuring that it was only about seven more years until
he expired, at which point we might be able to take all the fur he had
shed in his lifetime and weave ourselves some clothes without holes in
them, or quite possibly a house.

But miracle of miracles, we moved, and Sam instantly turned into the dog
we thought we'd gotten when we forked over \$500—calm, sweet, and
obedient. Weeks went by, and Sam was, if anything, better than ever.
Clearly, the change was permanent.

And then we took Sam to the vet for his annual check-up and found that
he had an ear infection. Thanks to the wonders of modern animal
medicine, a \$5 bottle of liquid restored his health in just two days.
And with his health, we got, as a bonus, the old Sam. You see, Sam
hadn't changed. He was just tired from being sick. Now he once again
joyously knocks down any stranger who makes the mistake of glancing in
his direction, and will, quite possibly, be booked any day now on
suspicion of homicide by licking.

### Plus ça Change

Okay, you give up. What exactly does this have to do with graphics? I'm
glad you asked. The lesson to be learned from Sam, The Dog With A Brain
The Size Of A Walnut, is that while things may *look* like they've
changed, in fact they often haven't. Take VGA performance. If you buy a
486 with a SuperVGA, you'll get performance that knocks your socks off,
especially if you run Windows. Things are liable to be so fast that
you'll figure the SuperVGA has to deserve some of the credit. Well,
maybe it does if it's a local-bus VGA. But maybe it doesn't, even if it
is local bus—and it certainly doesn't if it's an ISA bus VGA, because no
ISA bus VGA can run faster than about 300 nanoseconds per access, and
VGAs capable of that speed have been common for at least a couple of
years now.

Your 486 VGA system is fast almost entirely because it has a 486 in it.
(486 systems with graphics accelerators such as the ATI Ultra or Diamond
Stealth are another story altogether.) Underneath it all, the VGA is
still painfully slow—and if you have an old VGA or IBM's original PS/2
motherboard VGA, it's incredibly slow. The fastest ISA-bus VGA around is
two to twenty times slower than system memory, and the slowest VGA
around is as much as 100 times slower. In the old days, the rule was,
"Display memory is slow, and should be avoided." Nowadays, the rule is,
"Display memory is not quite so slow, but should still be avoided."

So, as I say, sometimes things don't change. Of course, sometimes they
do change. For example, in just 49 dog years, I fully expect to own at
least one pair of underwear without a single hole in it. Which brings
us, deus ex machina and the creek don't rise, to yet another animation
method: dirty-rectangle animation.

### VGA Access Times

Actually, before we get to dirty rectangles, I'd like to take you
through a quick refresher on VGA memory and I/O access times. I want to
do this partly because the slow access times of the VGA make
dirty-rectangle animation particularly attractive, and partly as a
public service, because even I was shocked by the results of some I/O
performance tests I recently ran.

Table 45.1 shows the results of the aforementioned I/O performance
tests, as run on two 486/33 SuperVGA systems under the Phar Lap
386|DOS-Extender. (The systems and VGAs are unnamed because this is a
not-very-scientific spot test, and I don't want to unfairly malign, say,
a VGA whose only sin is being plugged into a lousy motherboard, or vice
versa.) Under Phar Lap, 32-bit protected-mode apps run with full I/O
privileges, meaning that the `OUT` instructions I measured had the
best official cycle times possible on the 486: 10 cycles. `OUT`
officially takes 16 cycles in real mode on a 486, and officially takes a
mind-boggling 30 cycles in protected mode if running *without* full I/O
privileges (as is normally the case for protected-mode applications).
Basically, I/O is just plain slow on a 486.

As slow as 30 or even 10 cycles is for an `OUT`, one could only wish
that VGA I/O were actually that fast. The fastest measured `OUT` to a
VGA in Table 45.1 is 26 cycles, and the slowest is 126—this for an
operation that's *supposed* to take 10 cycles. To put this in context,
`MUL` takes only 13 to 42 cycles, and a normal `MOV` to or from
system memory takes exactly one cycle on the 486. In short, `OUT`s to
VGAs are as much as 100 times slower than normal memory accesses, and
are generally two to four times slower than even display memory
accesses, although there are exceptions.

Of course, VGA display memory has its own performance problems. The
fastest ISA bus VGA can, at best, support sustained write times of about
10 cycles per word-sized write on a 486/33; 15 or 20 cycles is more
common, even for relatively fast SuperVGAs; the worst case I've seen is
65 cycles per byte. However, intermittent writes, mixed with a lot of
register and cache-only code, can effectively execute in one cycle,
thanks to the caching design of many VGAs and the 486's 4-deep write
buffer, which stores pending writes while the CPU continues executing
instructions. Display memory reads tend to take longer, because
coprocessing isn't possible—one microsecond is a reasonable rule of
thumb for VGA reads, although there's considerable variation. So VGA
memory tends not to be as bad as VGA I/O, but lord knows it isn't
*good*.

**OUT Time in Microseconds and Cycles**

| OUT Instruction | Official Time | 486 #1/16-bit VGA #1 | 486 #2/16-bit VGA #2 |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| OUT DX,AL repeated 1,000 times nonstop (maximum byte access)                    | 0.300s 10 cycles | 2.546s 84 cycles  | 0.813s 27 cycles |
| OUT DX,AX repeated 1,000 times nonstop (maximum word access)                    | 0.300s 10 cycles | 3.820s 126 cycles | 1.066s 35 cycles |
| OUT DX,AL repeated 1,000 times, but interspersed with MULs (random byte access) | 0.300s 10 cycles | 1.610s 53 cycles  | 0.780s 26 cycles |
| OUT DX,AX repeated 1,000 times, but interspersed with MULs (random word access) | 0.300s 10 cycles | 2.830s 93 cycles  | 1.010s 33 cycles |

For graphics, this especially means using write mode 3 rather than the
bit-mask register. When you must use the bit mask, arrange drawing so
that you can set the bit mask once, then do a lot of drawing with that
mask. For example, draw a whole edge at once, then the middle, then the
other edge, rather than setting the bit mask several times on each scan
line to draw the edge and middle bytes together. Don't read from display
memory if you don't have to. Write each pixel once and only once.

It is indeed a strange concept: The key to fast graphics is staying away
from the graphics adapter as much as possible.

### Dirty-Rectangle Animation

The relative slowness of VGA hardware is part of the appeal of the
technique that I call "dirty-rectangle" animation, in which a complete
copy of the contents of display memory is maintained in offscreen system
(nondisplay) memory. All drawing is done to this system buffer. As
offscreen drawing is done, a list is maintained of the bounding
rectangles for the drawn-to areas; these are the *dirty rectangles*,
"dirty" in the sense that that have been altered and no longer match the
contents of the screen. After all drawing for a frame is completed, all
the dirty rectangles for that frame are copied to the screen in a burst,
and then the cycle of off-screen drawing begins again.

Why, exactly, would we want to go through all this complication, rather
than simply drawing to the screen in the first place? The reason is
visual quality. If we were to do all our drawing directly to the screen,
there'd be a lot of flicker as objects were erased and then redrawn.
Similarly, overlapped drawing done with the painter's algorithm (in
which farther objects are drawn first, so that nearer objects obscure
them) would flicker as farther objects were visible for short periods.
With dirty-rectangle animation, only the finished pixels for any given
frame ever appear on the screen; intermediate results are never visible.
Figure 45.1 illustrates the visual problems associated with drawing
directly to the screen; Figure 45.2 shows how dirty-rectangle animation
solves these problems.

![**Figure 45.1**  *Drawing directly to the screen.*](../images/45-01.jpg)

![**Figure 45.2**  *Dirty rectangle animation.*](../images/45-02.jpg)

#### So Why Not Use Page Flipping?

Well, then, if we want good visual quality, why not use page flipping?
For one thing, not all adapters and all modes support page flipping. The
CGA and MCGA don't, and neither do the VGA's 640x480 16-color or 320x200
256-color modes, or many SuperVGA modes. In contrast, *all* adapters
support dirty-rectangle animation. Another advantage of dirty-rectangle
animation is that it's generally faster. While it may seem strange that
it would be faster to draw off-screen and then copy the result to the
screen, that is often the case, because dirty-rectangle animation
usually reduces the number of times the VGA's hardware needs to be
touched, especially in 256-color modes.

This reduction comes about because when dirty rectangles are erased,
it's done in system memory, not in display memory, and since most
objects move a good deal less than their full width (that is, the new
and old positions overlap), display memory is written to fewer times
than with page flipping. (In 16-color modes, this is not necessarily the
case, because of the parallelism obtained from the VGA's planar
hardware.) Also, read/modify/write operations are performed in fast
system memory rather than slow display memory, so display memory rarely
needs to be read. This is particularly good because display memory is
generally even slower for reads than for writes.

Also, page flipping wastes a good deal of time waiting for the page to
flip at the end of the frame. Dirty-rectangle animation never needs to
wait for anything because partially drawn images are never present in
display memory. Actually, in one sense, partially drawn images are
sometimes present because it's possible for a rectangle to be partially
drawn when the scanning raster beam reaches that part of the screen.
This causes the rectangle to appear partially drawn for one frame,
producing a phenomenon I call "shearing." Fortunately, shearing tends
not to be particularly distracting, especially for fairly small images,
but it can be a problem when copying large areas. This is one area in
which dirty-rectangle animation falls short of page flipping, because
page flipping has perfect display quality, never showing anything other
than a completely finished frame. Similarly, dirty-rectangle copying may
take two or more frame times to finish, so even if shearing doesn't
happen, it's still possible to have the images in the various dirty
rectangles show up non-simultaneously. In my experience, this latter
phenomenon is not a serious problem, but do be aware of it.

### Dirty Rectangles in Action

Listing 45.1 demonstrates dirty-rectangle animation. This is a very
simple implementation, in several respects. For one thing, it's written
entirely in C, and animation fairly cries out for assembly language. For
another thing, it uses far pointers, which C often handles with less
than optimal efficiency, especially because I haven't used library
functions to copy and fill memory. (I did this so the code would work in
any memory model.) Also, Listing 45.1 doesn't attempt to coalesce
rectangles so as to perform a minimum number of display-memory accesses;
instead, it copies each dirty rectangle to the screen, even if it
overlaps with another rectangle, so some pixels are copied multiple
times. Listing 45.1 runs pretty well, considering all of its failings;
on my 486/33, 10 11x11 images animate at a very respectable clip.

         /* Point to the next row */
         RowPtr += SCREEN_WIDTH;
      }
   }
}
```

One point I'd like to make is that although the system-memory buffer in
Listing 45.1 has exactly the same dimensions as the screen bitmap,
that's not a requirement, and there are some good reasons not to make
the two the same size. For example, if the system buffer is bigger than
the area displayed on the screen, it's possible to pan the visible area
around the system buffer. Or, alternatively, the system buffer can be
just the size of a desired window, representing a window into a larger,
virtual buffer. We could then draw the desired portion of the virtual
bitmap into the system-memory buffer, then copy the buffer to the
screen, and the effect will be of having panned the window to the new
location.

If you keep a close watch, you'll notice that many high-performance
animation games similarly restrict their full-featured animation area to
a relatively small region. Often, it's hard to tell that this is the
case, because the animation region is surrounded by flashy digitized
graphics and by items such as scoreboards and status screens, but look
closely and see if the animation region in your favorite game isn't
smaller than you thought.

### Hi-Res VGA Page Flipping

On a standard VGA, hi-res mode is mode 12H, which offers 640x480
resolution with 16 colors. That's a nice mode, with plenty of pixels,
and square ones at that, but it lacks one thing—page flipping. The
problem is that the mode 12H bitmap is 150 K in size, and the standard
VGA has only 256 K total, too little memory for two of those monster
mode 12H pages. With only one page, flipping is obviously out of the
question, and without page flipping, top-flight, hi-res animation can't
be implemented. The standard fallback is to use the EGA's hi-res mode,
mode 10H (640x350, 16 colors) for page flipping, but this mode is less
than ideal for a couple of reasons: It offers sharply lower vertical
resolution, and it's lousy for handling scaled-up CGA graphics, because
the vertical resolution is a fractional multiple—1.75 times, to be
exact—of that of the CGA. CGA resolution may not seem important these
days, but many images were originally created for the CGA, as were many
graphics packages and games, and it's at least convenient to be able to
handle CGA graphics easily. Then, too, 640x350 is also a poor multiple
of the 200 scan lines of the popular 320x200 256-color mode 13H of the
VGA.

There are a couple of interesting, if imperfect, solutions to the
problem of hi-res page flipping. One is to use the split screen to
enable page flipping only in the top two-thirds of the screen; see the
previous chapter for details, and for details on the mechanics of page
flipping generally. This doesn't address the CGA problem, but it does
yield square pixels and a full 640x480 screen resolution, although not
all those pixels are flippable and thus animatable.

A second solution is to program the screen to a 640x400 mode. Such a
mode uses almost every byte of display memory (64,000 bytes, actually;
you could add another few lines, if you really wanted to), and thereby
provides the highest resolution possible on the VGA for a fully
page-flipped display. It maps well to CGA and mode 13H resolutions,
being either identical or double in both dimensions. As an added
benefit, it offers an easy-on-the-eyes 70-Hz frame rate, as opposed to
the 60 Hz that is the best that mode 12H can offer, due to the design of
standard VGA monitors. Best of all, perhaps, is that 640x400 16-color
mode is easy to set up.

The key to 640x400 mode is understanding that on a VGA, mode 10H
(640x350) is, at heart, a 400-scan-line mode. What I mean by that is
that in mode 10H, the Vertical Total register, which controls the total
number of scan lines, both displayed and nondisplayed, is set to 447,
exactly the same as in the VGA's text modes, which do in fact support
400 scan lines. A properly sized and centered display is achieved in
mode 10H by setting the polarity of the sync pulses to tell the monitor
to scan vertically at a faster rate (to make fewer lines fill the
screen), by starting the overscan after 350 lines, and by setting the
vertical sync and blanking pulses appropriately for the faster vertical
scanning rate. Changing those settings is all that's required to turn
mode 10H into a 640x400 mode, and that's easy to do, as illustrated by
Listing 45.2, which provides mode set code for 640x400 mode.

In 640x400, 16-color mode, page 0 runs from offset 0 to offset 31,999
(7CFFH), and page 1 runs from offset 32,000 (7D00H) to 63,999 (0F9FFH).
Page 1 is selected by programming the Start Address registers (CRTC
registers 0CH, the high 8 bits, and 0DH, the low 8 bits) to 7D00H.
Actually, because the low byte of the start address is 0 for both pages,
you can page flip simply by writing 0 or 7DH to the Start Address High
register (CRTC register 0CH); this has the benefit of eliminating a
nasty class of potential synchronization bugs that can arise when both
registers must be set. Listing 45.3 illustrates simple 640x400 page
flipping.

After I described 640x400 mode in a magazine article, Bill Lindley, of
Mesa, Arizona, wrote me to suggest that when programming the VGA to a
nonstandard mode of this sort, it's a good idea to tell the BIOS about
the new screen size, for a couple of reasons. For one thing, pop-up
utilities often use the BIOS variables; Bill's memory-resident screen
printer, EGAD Screen Print, determines the number of scan lines to print
by multiplying the BIOS "number of text rows" variable times the
"character height" variable. For another, the BIOS itself may do a poor
job of displaying text if not given proper information; the active text
area may not match the screen dimensions, or an inappropriate graphics
font may be used. (Of course, the BIOS isn't going to be able to display
text anyway in highly nonstandard modes such as Mode X, but it will do
fine in slightly nonstandard modes such as 640x400 16-color mode.) In
the case of the 640x400 16-color model described a little earlier, Bill
suggests that the code in Listing 45.4 be called immediately after
putting the VGA into that mode to tell the BIOS that we're working with
25 rows of 16-pixel-high text. I think this is an excellent suggestion;
it can't hurt, and may save you from getting aggravating tech support
calls down the road.

**LISTING 45.4 L45-4.C**

```c
/* Function to tell the BIOS to set up properly sized characters for 25 rows of

   Based on a contribution by Bill Lindley. */

#include <dos.h>

void Set640x400()
{
   union REGS regs;

   regs.h.ah = 0x11;                    /* character generator function */
   regs.h.al = 0x24;                    /* use ROM 8x6 character set for graphics */
   regs.h.bl = 2;                       /* 25 rows */
   int86(0x10, &regs, &regs);           /* invoke the BIOS video interrupt
                                           to set up the text */
}
```

The 640x400 mode I've described here isn't exactly earthshaking, but it
can come in handy for page flipping and CGA emulation, and I'm sure that
some of you will find it useful at one time or another.

### Another Interesting Twist on Page Flipping

I've spent a fair amount of time exploring various ways to do animation.
I thought I had pegged all the possible ways to do animation:
exclusive-ORing; simply drawing and erasing objects; drawing objects
with a blank fringe to erase them at their old locations as they're
drawn; page flipping; and, finally, drawing to local memory and copying
the dirty (modified) rectangles to the screen, as I've discussed in this
chapter.

To my surprise, someone threw me an interesting and useful twist on
animation not long ago, which turned out to be a cross between page
flipping and dirty-rectangle animation. That someone was Serge Mathieu
of Concepteva Inc., in Rosemere, Quebec, who informed me that he designs
everything "from a game *point de vue*."

In normal page flipping, you display one page while you update the other
page. Then you display the new page while you update the other. This
works fine, but the need to keep two pages current can make for a lot of
bookkeeping and possibly extra drawing, especially in applications where
only some of the objects are redrawn each time.

Serge didn't care to do all that bookkeeping in his animation
applications, so he came up with the following approach, which I've
reworded, amplified, and slightly modified in the summary here:

  1. Set the start address to display page 0.

  2. Draw to page 1.

  3. Set the start address to display page 1 (the newly drawn page),
     then wait for the leading edge of vertical sync, at which point the page
     has flipped and it's safe to modify page 0.

  4. Copy, via the latches, from page 1 to page 0 the areas that
     changed from the previous screen to the current one.

  5. Set the start address to display page 0, which is now identical
     to page 1, then wait for the leading edge of vertical sync, at which
     point the page has flipped and it's safe to modify page 1.

  6. Go to step 2.

The great benefit of Serge's approach is that the only page that is ever
actually drawn to (as opposed to being block-copied to) is page 1. Only
one page needs to be maintained, and the complications of maintaining
two separate pages vanish entirely. The performance of Serge's approach
may be better or worse than standard page flipping, depending on whether
a lot of extra work is required to maintain two pages or not. My guess
is that Serge's approach will usually be slower, owing to the
considerable amount of display-memory copying involved, and also to the
double page-flip per frame. There's no doubt, however, that Serge's
approach is simpler, and the resultant display quality is every bit as
good as standard page flipping. Given page flipping's fair degree of
complication, this approach is a valuable tool, especially for
less-experienced animation programmers.

An interesting variation on Serge's approach doesn't page flip nor wait
for vertical sync:

  1. Set the start address to display page 0.

  2. Draw to page 1.

  3. Copy, via the latches, the areas that changed from the last
     screen to the current one from page 1 to page 0.

  4. Go to step 2.

This approach totally eliminates page flipping, which can consume a
great deal of time. The downside is that images may shear for one frame
if they're only partially copied when the raster beam reaches them. This
approach is basically a standard dirty-rectangle approach, except that
the drawing buffer is stored in display memory, rather than in system
memory. Whether this technique is faster than drawing to system memory
depends on whether the benefit you get from the VGA's hardware, such as
the Bit Mask, the ALUs, and especially the latches (for copying the
dirty rectangles) is sufficient to outweigh the extra display-memory
accesses involved in drawing and copying, since display memory is
notoriously slow.

Finally, I'd like to point out that in any scheme that involves changing
the display-memory start address, a clever trick can potentially reduce
the time spent waiting for pages to flip. Normally, it's necessary to
wait for display enable to be active, then set the two start address
registers, and finally wait for vertical sync to be active, so that you
know the new start address has taken effect. The start-address registers
must never be set around the time vertical sync is active (the new start
address is accepted at either the start or end of vertical sync on the
EGAs and VGAs I'm familiar with), because it would then be possible to
load a half-changed start address (one register loaded, the other not
yet loaded), and the screen would jump for a frame. Avoiding this
condition is the motivation for waiting for display enable, because
display enable is active only when vertical sync is not active and will
not become active for a long while.

Suppose, however, that you arrange your page start addresses so that
they both have a low-byte value of 0 (page 0 starts at 0000H, and page 1
starts at 8000H, for example). Page flipping can then be done simply by
setting the new high byte of the start address, then waiting for the
leading edge of vertical sync. This eliminates the need to wait for
display enable (the two bytes of the start address can never be
mismatched); page flipping will often involve less waiting, because
display enable becomes inactive long before vertical sync becomes
active. Using the above approach reclaims all the time between the end
of display enable and the start of vertical sync for doing useful work.
(The steps I've given for Serge's animation approach assume that the
single-byte approach is in use; that's why display enable is never
waited for.)

In the next chapter, I'll return to the original dirty-rectangle
algorithm presented in this chapter, and goose it a little with some
assembly, so that we can see what dirty-rectangle animation is really
made of. (Probably not dog hair....)
