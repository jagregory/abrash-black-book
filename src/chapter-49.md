## Chapter 49 -- Mode X 256-Color Animation

### How to Make the VGA Really Get up and Dance

Okay—no amusing stories or informative anecdotes to kick off this
chapter; lotta ground to cover, gotta hurry—you're impatient, I can
smell it. I won't talk about the time a friend made the mistake of
loudly saying "\$100 bill" during an animated discussion while walking
among the bums on Market Street in San Francisco one night, thereby
graphically illustrating that context is everything. I can't spare a
word about how my daughter thinks my 11-year-old floppy-disk-based CP/M
machine is more powerful than my 386 with its 100-MB hard disk because
the CP/M machine's word processor loads and runs twice as fast as the
386's Windows-based word processor, demonstrating that progress is not
the neat exponential curve we'd like to think it is, and that features
and performance are often conflicting notions. And, lord knows, I can't
take the time to discuss the habits of small white dogs, notwithstanding
that such dogs seem to be relevant to just about every aspect of
computing, as Jeff Duntemann's writings make manifest. No lighthearted
fluff for us; we have real work to do, for today we animate with 256
colors in Mode X.

### Masked Copying

Over the past two chapters, we've put together most of the tools needed
to implement animation in the VGA's undocumented 320x240 256-color Mode
X. We now have mode set code, solid and 4x4 pattern fills, system
memory-to-display memory block copies, and display memory-to-display
memory block copies. The final piece of the puzzle is the ability to
copy a nonrectangular image to display memory. I call this *masked
copying*.

Masked copying is sort of like drawing through a stencil, in that only
certain pixels within the destination rectangle are drawn. The objective
is to fit the image seamlessly into the background, without the
rectangular fringe that results when nonrectangular images are drawn by
block copying their bounding rectangle. This is accomplished by using a
second rectangular bitmap, separate from the image but corresponding to
it on a pixel-by-pixel basis, to control which destination pixels are
set from the source and which are left unchanged. With a masked copy,
only those pixels properly belonging to an image are drawn, and the
image fits perfectly into the background, with no rectangular border. In
fact, masked copying even makes it possible to have transparent areas
within images.

Note that another way to achieve this effect is to implement copying
code that supports a transparent color; that is, a color that doesn't
get copied but rather leaves the destination unchanged. Transparent
copying makes for more compact images, because no separate mask is
needed, and is generally faster in a software-only implementation.
However, Mode X supports masked copying but not transparent copying in
hardware, so we'll use masked copying in this chapter.

The system memory to display memory masked copy routine in Listing 49.1
implements masked copying in a straightforward fashion. In the main
drawing loop, the corresponding mask byte is consulted as each image
pixel is encountered, and the image pixel is copied only if the mask
byte is nonzero. As with most of the system-to-display code I've
presented, Listing 49.1 is not heavily optimized, because it's
inherently slow; there's a better way to go when performance matters,
and that's to use the VGA's hardware.

#### Faster Masked Copying

In the previous chapter we saw how the VGA's latches can be used to copy
four pixels at a time from one area of display memory to another in Mode
X. We've further seen that in Mode X the Map Mask register can be used
to select which planes are copied. That's all we need to know to be able
to perform fast masked copies; we can store an image in off-screen
display memory, and set the Map Mask to the appropriate mask value as up
to four pixels at a time are copied.

There's a slight hitch, though. The latches can only be used when the
source and destination left edge coordinates, modulo four, are the same,
as explained in the previous chapter. The solution is to copy all four
possible alignments of each image to display memory, each properly
positioned for one of the four possible
destination-left-edge-modulo-four cases. These aligned images must be
accompanied by the four possible alignments of the image mask, stored in
system memory. Given all four image and mask alignments, masked copying
is a simple matter of selecting the alignment that's appropriate for the
destination's left edge, then setting the Map Mask with the 4-bit mask
corresponding to each four-pixel set as we copy four pixels at a time
via the latches.

Listing 49.2 performs fast masked copying. This code expects to receive
a pointer to a `MaskedImage` structure, which in turn points to four
`AlignedMaskedImage` structures that describe the four possible image
and mask alignments. The aligned images are already stored in display
memory, and the aligned masks are already stored in system memory;
further, the masks are predigested into Map Mask register-compatible
form. Given all that ready-to-use data, Listing 49.2 selects and works
with the appropriate image-mask pair for the destination's left edge
alignment.

It would be handy to have a function that, given a base image and mask,
generates the four image and mask alignments and fills in the
`MaskedImage` structure. Listing 49.3, together with the include file
in Listing 49.4 and the system memory-to-display memory block-copy
routine in Listing 48.4 (in the previous chapter) does just that. It
would be faster if Listing 49.3 were in assembly language, but there's
no reason to think that generating aligned images needs to be
particularly fast; in such cases, I prefer to use C, for reasons of
coding speed, fewer bugs, and maintainability.

/* Generates all four possible mode X image/mask alignments, stores image
alignments in display memory, allocates memory for and generates mask
alignments, and fills out an AlignedMaskedImage structure. Image and mask must
both be in byte-per-pixel form, and must both be of width ImageWidth. Mask
maps isomorphically (one to one) onto image, with each 0-byte in mask masking
off corresponding image pixel (causing it not to be drawn), and each non-0-byte
allowing corresponding image pixel to be drawn. Returns 0 if failure, or # of
display memory addresses (4-pixel sets) used if success. For simplicity,
allocated memory is not deallocated in case of failure. Compiled with
Borland C++ in C compilation mode. */

#### Notes on Masked Copying

Listings 49.1 and 49.2, like all Mode X code I've presented, perform no
clipping, because clipping code would complicate the listings too much.
While clipping can be implemented directly in the low-level Mode X
routines (at the beginning of Listing 49.1, for instance), another,
potentially simpler approach would be to perform clipping at a higher
level, modifying the coordinates and dimensions passed to low-level
routines such as Listings 49.1 and 49.2 as necessary to accomplish the
desired clipping. It is for precisely this reason that the low-level
Mode X routines support programmable start coordinates in the source
images, rather than assuming (0,0); likewise for the distinction between
the width of the image and the width of the area of the image to draw.

Also, it would be more efficient to make up structures that describe the
source and destination bitmaps, with dimensions and coordinates built
in, and simply pass pointers to these structures to the low level,
rather than passing many separate parameters, as is now the case. I've
used separate parameters for simplicity and flexibility.

> ![](../images/i.jpg)
> Be aware that as nifty as Mode X hardware-assisted masked copying is,
> whether or not it's actually faster than software-only masked or
> transparent copying depends upon the processor and the video adapter.
> The advantage of Mode X masked copying is the 32-bit parallelism; the

### Animation

Gosh. There's just no way I can discuss high-level animation
fundamentals in any detail here; I could spend an entire (and entirely
separate) book on animation techniques alone. You might want to have a
look at Chapters 43 through 46 before attacking the code in this
chapter; that will have to do us for the present volume. (I will return
to *3-D* animation in the next chapter.)

Basically, I'm going to perform page flipped animation, in which one
page (that is, a bitmap large enough to hold a full screen) of display
memory is displayed while another page is drawn to. When the drawing is
finished, the newly modified page is displayed, and the other—now
invisible—page is drawn to. The process repeats ad infinitum. For
further information, some good places to start are *Computer Graphics*,
by Foley and van Dam (Addison-Wesley); *Principles of Interactive
Computer Graphics*, by Newman and Sproull (McGraw Hill); and "Real-Time
Animation" by Rahner James (January 1990, *Dr. Dobb's Journal*).

Some of the code in this chapter was adapted for Mode X from the code in
Chapter 44—yet another reason to read that chapter before finishing this
one.

### Mode X Animation in Action

Listing 49.5 ties together everything I've discussed about Mode X so far
in a compact but surprisingly powerful animation package. Listing 49.5
first uses solid and patterned fills and system-memory-to-screen-memory
masked copying to draw a static background containing a mountain, a sun,
a plain, water, and a house with puffs of smoke coming out of the
chimney, and sets up the four alignments of a masked kite image. The
background is transferred to both display pages, and drawing of 20 kite
images in the nondisplayed page using fast masked copying begins. After
all images have been drawn, the page is flipped to show the newly
updated screen, and the kites are moved and drawn in the other page,
which is no longer displayed. Kites are erased at their old positions in
the nondisplayed page by block copying from the background page. (See
the discussion in the previous chapter for the display memory
organization used by Listing 49.5.) So far as the displayed image is
concerned, there is never any hint of flicker or disturbance of the
background. This continues at a rate of up to 60 times a second until
Esc is pressed to exit the program. See Figure 49.1 for a screen shot of
the resulting image—add the animation in your imagination.

Here's something worth noting: The animation is extremely smooth on a 20
MHz 386. It is somewhat more jerky on an 8 MHz 286, because only 30
frames a second can be processed. If animation looks jerky on your PC,
try reducing the number of kites.

The kites draw perfectly into the background, with no interference or
fringe, thanks to masked copying. In fact, the kites also cross with no
interference (the last-drawn kite is always in front), although that's
not readily apparent because they all look the same anyway and are
moving fast. Listing 49.5 isn't inherently limited to kites; create your
own images and initialize the object list to display a mix of those
images and see the full power of Mode X animation.

The external functions called by Listing 49.5 can be found in Listings
49.1, 49.2, 49.3, and 49.6, and in the listings for the previous two
chapters.

### Works Fast, Looks Great

We now end our exploration of Mode X, although we'll use it again
shortly for 3-D animation. Mode X admittedly has its complexities;
that's why I've provided a broad and flexible primitive set. Still, so
what if it *is* complex? Take a look at Listing 49.5 in action. That
sort of colorful, high-performance animation is worth jumping through a
few hoops for; drawing 20, or even 10, fair-sized objects at a rate of
60 Hz, with no flicker, interference, or fringe, is no mean
accomplishment, even on a 386.

There's much more we could do with animation in general and with Mode X
in particular, but it's time to move on to new challenges. In closing,
I'd like to point out that all of the VGA's hardware features, including
the built-in AND, OR, and XOR functions, are available in Mode X, just
as they are in the standard VGA modes. If you understand the VGA's
hardware in mode 12H, try applying that knowledge to Mode X; you might
be surprised at what you find you can do.
