## Chapter 33 -- Yogi Bear and Eurythmics Confront VGA Colors

### The Basics of VGA Color Generation

Kevin Mangis wants to know about the VGA's 4-bit to 8-bit to 18-bit
color translation. Mansur Loloyan would like to find out how to generate
a look-up table containing 256 colors and how to change the default
color palette. And surely they are only the tip of the iceberg; hordes
of screaming programmers from every corner of the planet are no doubt
tearing the place up looking for a discussion of VGA color, and venting
their frustration at my mailbox. *Let's have it*, they've said, clearly
and in considerable numbers. As Eurythmics might say, who is this humble
writer to disagree?

On the other hand, I hope you all know what you're getting into. To
paraphrase Yogi, the VGA is smarter (and more confusing) than the
average board. There's the basic 8-bit to 18-bit translation, there's
the EGA-compatible 4-bit to 6-bit translation, there's the 2- or 4-bit
color paging register that's used to pad 6- or 4-bit pixel values out to
8 bits, and then there's 256-color mode. Fear not, it will all make
sense in the end, but it may take us a couple of additional chapters to
get there—so let's get started.

Before we begin, though, I must refer you to Michael Covington's
excellent article, "Color Vision and the VGA," in the June/July 1990
issue of *PC TECHNIQUES*. Michael, one of the most brilliant people it
has ever been my pleasure to meet, is an expert in many areas I know
nothing about, including linguistics and artificial intelligence. Add to
that list the topic of color perception, for his article superbly
describes the mechanisms by which we perceive color and ties that
information to the VGA's capabilities. After reading Michael's article,
you'll understand what colors the VGA is capable of generating, and why.

Our topic in this chapter complements Michael's article nicely. Where he
focused on color perception, we'll focus on color generation; that is,
the ways in which the VGA can be programmed to generate those colors
that lie within its capabilities. To find out why a VGA can't generate
as pure a red as an LED, read Michael's article. If you want to find out
how to flip between 16 different sets of 16 colors, though, don't touch
that dial!

I would be remiss if I didn't point you in the direction of two more
articles, these in the July 1990 issue of *Dr. Dobb's Journal*. "Super
VGA Programming," by Chris Howard, provides a good deal of useful
information about SuperVGA chipsets, modes, and programming. "Circles
and the Digital Differential Analyzer," by Tim Paterson, is a good
article about fast circle drawing, a topic we'll tackle soon. All in
all, the dog days of 1990 were good times for graphics.

### VGA Color Basics

Briefly put, the VGA color translation circuitry takes in one 4- or
8-bit pixel value at a time and translates it into three 6-bit values,
one each of red, green, and blue, that are converted to corresponding
analog levels and sent to the monitor. Seems simple enough, doesn't it?
Unfortunately, nothing is ever that simple on the VGA, and color
translation is no exception.

#### The Palette RAM

The color path in the VGA involves two stages, as shown in Figure 33.1.
The first stage fetches a 4-bit pixel from display memory and feeds it
into the EGA-compatible palette RAM (so called because it is
functionally equivalent to the palette RAM color translation circuitry
of the EGA), which translates it into a 6-bit value and sends it on to
the DAC. The translation involves nothing more complex than the 4-bit
value of a pixel being used as the address of one of the 16 palette RAM
registers; a pixel value of 0 selects the contents of palette RAM
register 0, a pixel value of 1 selects register 1, and so on. Each
palette RAM register stores 6 bits, so each time a palette RAM register
is selected by an incoming 4-bit pixel value, 6 bits of information are
sent out by the palette RAM. (The operation of the palette RAM was
described back in Chapter 29.)

The process is much the same in text mode, except that in text mode each
4-bit pixel value is generated based on the character's font pattern and
attribute. In 256-color mode, which we'll get to eventually, the palette
RAM is not a factor from the programmer's perspective and should be left
alone.

#### The DAC

Once the EGA-compatible palette RAM has fulfilled its karma and
performed 4-bit to 6-bit translation on a pixel, the resulting value is
sent to the DAC (Digital/Analog Converter). The DAC performs an 8-bit to
18-bit conversion in much the same manner as the palette RAM, converts
the 18-bit result to analog red, green, and blue signals (6 bits for
each signal), and sends the three analog signals to the monitor. The DAC
is a separate chip, external to the VGA chip, but it's an integral part
of the VGA standard and is present on every VGA.

![**Figure 33.1**  *The VGA color generation path.*](../images/33-01.jpg)

(I'd like to take a moment to point out that you can't speak of "color"
at any point in the color translation process until the output stage of
the DAC. The 4-bit pixel values in memory, 6-bit values in the palette
RAM, and 8-bit values sent to the DAC are all attributes, not colors,
because they're subject to translation by a later stage. For example, a
pixel with a 4-bit value of 0 isn't black, it's attribute 0. It will be
translated to 3FH if palette RAM register 0 is set to 3FH, but that's
not the color white, just another attribute. The value 3FH coming into
the DAC isn't white either, and if the value stored in DAC register 63
is red=7, green=0, and blue=0, the actual *color* displayed for that
pixel that was 0 in display memory will be dim red. It isn't color until
the DAC says it's color.)

The DAC contains 256 18-bit storage registers, used to translate one of
256 possible 8-bit values into one of 256K (262,144, to be precise)
18-bit values. The 18-bit values are actually composed of three 6-bit
values, one each for red, green, and blue; for each color component, the
higher the number, the brighter the color, with 0 turning that color off
in the pixel and 63 (3FH) making that color maximum brightness. Got all
that?

#### Color Paging with the Color Select Register

"Wait a minute," you say bemusedly. "Aren't you missing some bits
between the palette RAM and the DAC?" Indeed I am. The palette RAM puts
out 6 bits at a time, and the DAC takes in 8 bits at a time. The two
missing bits—bits 6 and 7 going into the DAC—are supplied by bits 2 and
3 of the Color Select register (Attribute Controller register 14H). This
has intriguing implications. In 16-color modes, pixel data can select
only one of 16 attributes, which the EGA palette RAM translates into one
of 64 attributes. Normally, those 64 attributes look up colors from
registers 0 through 63 in the DAC, because bits 2 and 3 of the Color
Select register are both zero. By changing the Color Select register,
however, one of three other 64 color sets can be selected instantly.
I'll refer to the process of flipping through color sets in this manner
as *color paging*.

That's interesting, but frankly it seems somewhat half-baked; why bother
expanding 16 attributes to 64 attributes before looking up the colors in
the DAC? What we'd *really* like is to map the 16 attributes straight
through the palette RAM without changing them and supply the upper *4*
bits going to the DAC from a register, giving us 16 color pages. As it
happens, all we have to do to make that happen is set bit 7 of the
Attribute Controller Mode register (register 10H) to 1. Once that's
done, bits 0 through 3 of the Color Select register go straight to bits
4 through 7 of the DAC, and only bits 3 through 0 coming out of the
palette RAM are used; bits 4 and 5 from the palette RAM are ignored. In
this mode, the palette RAM effectively contains 4-bit, rather than
6-bit, registers, but that's no problem because the palette RAM will be
programmed to pass pixel values through unchanged by having register 0
set to 0, register 1 set to 1, and so on, a configuration in which the
upper two bits of all the palette RAM registers are the same (zero) and
therefore irrelevant. As a matter of fact, you'll generally want to set
the palette RAM to this pass-through state when working with VGA color,
whether you're using color paging or not.

Why is it a good idea to set the palette RAM to a pass-through state?
It's a good idea because the palette RAM is programmed by the BIOS to
EGA-compatible settings and the first 64 DAC registers are programmed to
emulate the 64 colors that an EGA can display during mode sets for
16-color modes. This is done for compatibility with EGA programs, and
it's useless if you're going to tinker with the VGA's colors. As a VGA
programmer, you want to take a 4-bit pixel value and turn it into an
18-bit RGB value; you can do that without any help from the palette RAM,
and setting the palette RAM to pass-through values effectively takes it
out of the circuit and simplifies life something wonderful. The palette
RAM exists solely for EGA compatibility, and serves no useful purpose
that I know of for VGA-only color programming.

#### 256-Color Mode

So far I've spoken only of 16-color modes; what of 256-color modes?

The rule in 256-color modes is: *Don't tinker with the VGA palette*.
Period. You can select any colors you want by reprogramming the DAC, and
there's no guarantee as to what will happen if you mess around with the
palette RAM. There's no benefit that I know of to changing the palette
RAM in 256-color mode, and the effect may vary from VGA to VGA. So don't
do it unless you know something I don't.

On the other hand, feel free to alter the DAC settings to your heart's
content in 256-color mode, all the more so because this is the only mode
in which all 256 DAC settings can be displayed simultaneously. By the
way, the Color Select register and bit 7 of the Attribute Controller
Mode register are ignored in 256-color mode; all 8 bits sent from the
VGA chip to the DAC come from display memory. Therefore, there is no
color paging in 256-color mode. Of course, that makes sense given that
all 256 DAC registers are simultaneously in use in 256-color mode.

#### Setting the Palette RAM

The palette RAM can be programmed either directly or through BIOS
interrupt 10H, function 10H. I strongly recommend using the BIOS
interrupt; a clone BIOS may mask incompatibilities with genuine IBM
silicon. Such incompatibilities could include anything from flicker to
trashing the palette RAM; or they may not exist at all, but why find out
the hard way? My policy is to use the BIOS unless there's a clear reason
not to do so, and there's no such reason that I know of in this case.

When programming specifically for the VGA, the palette RAM needs to be
loaded only once, to store the pass-through values 0 through 15 in
palette RAM registers 0 through 15. Setting the entire palette RAM is
accomplished easily enough with subfunction 2 (AL=2) of function 10H
(AH=10H) of interrupt 10H. A single call to this subfunction sets all 16
palette RAM registers (and the Overscan register) from a block of 17
bytes pointed to by ES:DX, with ES:DX pointing to the value for register
0, ES:DX+1 pointing to the value for register 1, and so on up to
ES:DX+16, which points to the overscan value. The palette RAM registers
store 6 bits each, so only the lower 6 bits of each of the first 16
bytes in the 17-byte block are significant. (The Overscan register,
which specifies what's displayed between the area of the screen that's
controlled by the values in display memory and the blanked region at the
edges of the screen, is an 8-bit register, however.)

Alternatively, any one palette RAM register can be set via subfunction 0
(AL=0) of function 10H (AH=10H) of interrupt 10H. For this subfunction,
BL contains the number of the palette RAM register to set and the lower
6 bits of BH contain the value to which to set that register.

Having said that, let's leave the palette RAM behind (presumably in a
pass-through state) and move on to the DAC, which is the right place to
do color translation on the VGA.

#### Setting the DAC

Like the palette RAM, the DAC registers can be set either directly or
through the BIOS. Again, the BIOS should be used whenever possible, but
there are a few complications here. My experience is that varying
degrees of flicker and screen bounce occur on many VGAs when a large
block of DAC registers is set through the BIOS. That's not a problem
when the DAC is loaded just once and then left that way, as is the case
in Listing 33.1, which we'll get to shortly, but it can be a serious
problem when the color set is changed rapidly ("cycled") to produce
on-screen effects such as rippling colors. My (limited) experience is
that it's necessary to program the DAC directly in order to cycle colors
cleanly, although input from readers who have worked extensively with
VGA color is welcome.

At any rate, the code in this chapter will use the BIOS to set the DAC,
so I'll describe the BIOS DAC-setting functions next. Later, I'll
briefly describe how to set both the palette RAM and DAC registers
directly, and I'll return to the topic in detail in an upcoming chapter
when we discuss color cycling.

An individual DAC register can be set by interrupt 10H, function 10H
(AH=10), subfunction 10H (AL=10H), with BX indicating the register to be
set and the color to which that register is to be set stored in DH
(6-bit red component), CH (6-bit green component), and CL (6-bit blue
component).

A block of sequential DAC registers ranging in size from one register up
to all 256 can be set via subfunction 12H (AL=12H) of interrupt 10H,
function 10H (AH=10H). In this case, BX contains the number of the first
register to set, CX contains the number of registers to set, and ES:DX
contains the address of a table of color entries to which DAC registers
BX through BX+CX-1 are to be set. The color entry for each DAC register
consists of three bytes; the first byte is a 6-bit red component, the
second byte is a 6-bit green component, and the third byte is a 6-bit
blue component, as illustrated by Listing 33.1.

### If You Can't Call the BIOS, Who Ya Gonna Call?

Although the palette RAM and DAC registers should be set through the
BIOS whenever possible, there are times when the BIOS is not the best
choice or even a choice at all; for example, a protected-mode program
may not have access to the BIOS. Also, as mentioned earlier, it may be
necessary to program the DAC directly when performing color cycling.
Therefore, I'll briefly describe how to set the palette RAM and DAC
registers directly; in Chapter A on the companion CD-ROM I'll discuss
programming the DAC directly in more detail.

The palette RAM registers are Attribute Controller registers 0 through
15. They are set by first reading the Input Status 1 register (at 3DAH
in color mode or 3BAH in monochrome mode) to reset the Attribute
Controller toggle to index mode, then loading the Attribute Controller
Index register (at 3C0H) with the number (0 through 15) of the register
to be loaded. Do *not* set bit 5 of the Index register to 1, as you
normally would, but rather set bit 5 to 0. Setting bit 5 to 0 allows
values to be written to the palette RAM registers, but it also causes
the screen to blank, so you should wait for the start of vertical
retrace before loading palette RAM registers if you don't want the
screen to flicker. (Do you see why it's easier to go through the BIOS?)
Then, write the desired register value to 3C0H, which has now toggled to
become the Attribute Controller Data register. Write any desired number
of additional register number/register data pairs to 3C0H, then write
20H to 3C0H to unblank the screen.

The process of loading the palette RAM registers depends heavily on the
proper sequence being followed; if the Attribute Controller Index
register or index/data toggle data gets changed in the middle of the
loading process, you'll probably end up with a hideous display, or no
display at all. Consequently, for maximum safety you may want to disable
interrupts while you load the palette RAM, to prevent any sort of
interference from a TSR or the like that alters the state of the
Attribute Controller in the middle of the loading sequence.

The DAC registers are set by writing the number of the first register to
set to the DAC Write Index register at 3C8H, then writing three
bytes—the 6-bit red component, the 6-bit green component, and the 6-bit
blue component, in that order—to the DAC Data register at 3C9H. The DAC
Write Index register then autoincrements, so if you write another
three-byte RGB value to the DAC Data register, it'll go to the next DAC
register, and so on indefinitely; you can set all 256 registers by
sending 256\*3 = 768 bytes to the DAC Data Register.

Loading the DAC is just as sequence-dependent and potentially
susceptible to interference as is loading the palette, so my personal
inclination is to go through the whole process of disabling interrupts,
loading the DAC Write Index, and writing a three-byte RGB value
separately for each DAC register; although that doesn't take advantage
of the autoincrementing feature, it seems to me to be least susceptible
to outside influences. (It would be even better to disable interrupts
for the entire duration of DAC register loading, but that's much too
long a time to leave interrupts off.) However, I have no hard evidence
to offer in support of my conservative approach to setting the DAC, just
an uneasy feeling, so I'd be most interested in hearing from any
readers.

A final point is that the process of loading both the palette RAM and
DAC registers involves performing multiple `OUT`s to the same
register. Many people whose opinions I respect recommend delaying
between I/O accesses to the same port by performing a `JMP \$+2`
(jumping flushes the prefetch queue and forces a memory access—or at
least a cache access—to fetch the next instruction byte). In fact, some
people recommend two `JMP \$+2` instructions between I/O accesses to
the same port, and *three* jumps between I/O accesses to the same port
that go in opposite directions (`OUT` followed by `IN` or `IN`
followed by `OUT`). This is clearly necessary when accessing some
motherboard chips, but I don't know how applicable it is when accessing
VGAs, so make of it what you will. Input from knowledgeable readers is
eagerly solicited.

In the meantime, if you can use the BIOS to set the DAC, do so; then you
won't have to worry about the real and potential complications of
setting the DAC directly.

### An Example of Setting the DAC

This chapter has gotten about as big as a chapter really ought to be;
the VGA color saga will continue in the next few. Quickly, then, Listing
33.1 is a simple example of setting the DAC that gives you a taste of
the spectacular effects that color translation makes possible. There's
nothing particularly complex about Listing 33.1; it just selects
256-color mode, fills the screen with one-pixel-wide concentric diamonds
drawn with sequential attributes, and sets the DAC to produce a smooth
gradient of each of the three primary colors and of a mix of red and
blue. Run the program; I suspect you'll be surprised at the stunning
display this short program produces. Clever color manipulation is
perhaps the easiest way to produce truly eye-catching effects on the PC.

Note the jagged lines at the corners of the screen when you run Listing
33.1. This shows how coarse the 320x200 resolution of mode 13H actually
is. Now look at how smoothly the colors blend together in the rest of
the screen. This is an excellent example of how careful color selection
can boost perceived resolution, as for example when drawing antialiased
lines, as discussed in Chapter 42.

Finally, note that the border of the screen turns green when Listing
33.1 is run. Listing 33.1 reprograms DAC register 0 to green, and the
border attribute (in the Overscan register) happens to be 0, so the
border comes out green even though we haven't touched the Overscan
register. Normally, attribute 0 is black, causing the border to vanish,
but the border is an 8-bit attribute that has to pass through the DAC
just like any other pixel value, and it's just as subject to DAC color
translation as the pixels controlled by display memory. However, the
border color is not affected by the palette RAM or by the Color Select
register.

In this chapter, we traced the surprisingly complex path by which the
VGA turns a pixel value into RGB analog signals headed for the monitor.
In the next chapter and Chapter A on the companion CD-ROM, we'll look at
some more code that plays with VGA color. We'll explore in more detail
the process of reading and writing the palette RAM and DAC registers,
and we'll observe color paging and cycling in action.
