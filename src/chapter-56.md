## Chapter 56 -- Pooh and the Space Station

### Using Fast Texture Mapping to Place Pooh on a Polygon

So, here's where Winnie the Pooh lives: in a space station orbiting
Saturn. No, really; I have it straight from my daughter, and an
eight-year-old wouldn't make up something that important, would she? One
day she wondered aloud, "Where is the Hundred Acre Wood, exactly?" and
before I could give one of those boring parental responses about how it
was imaginary—but A.A. Milne probably imagined it to be somewhere near
London—my daughter announced that the Hundred Acre Wood was in a space
station orbiting Saturn, and there you have it.

As it turns out, that's a very good location for the Hundred Acre Wood,
leading to many exciting adventures for Pooh and Piglet. Consider the
time they went down to the Jupiter gravity level (we're talking
centrifugal force here; the station is spinning, of course) and nearly
turned into pancakes of the Pooh and Piglet varieties, respectively. Or
the time they drifted out into the free-fall area at the core and had to
be rescued by humans with wings strapped on (a tip of the hat to Robert
Heinlein here). Or the time they were caught up by the current in the
river through the Wood and drifted for weeks around the circumference of
the station, meeting many cultures and finding many adventures along the
way. (Yes, Farmer's Riverworld; no one said the stories you tell your
children need to be purely original, just interesting.)

(If you think Pooh and Piglet in a space station is a tad peculiar, then
I won't even mention Karla, the woman who invented agriculture,
medicine, sanitation, reading and writing, peace, and just about
everything else while travelling the length of the Americas with her
mountain lion during the last Ice Age; or the Mars Cats and their trip
in suspended animation to the Lesser Magellenic Cloud and beyond; or
most assuredly Little Whale, the baby Universe Whale that is naughty
enough to eat inhabited universes. But I digress.)

Anyway, I bring up Pooh and the space station because the time has come
to discuss fast texture mapping. *Texture mapping* is the process of
mapping an image (in our case, a bitmap) onto the surface of a polygon
that's been transformed in the process of 3-D drawing. Up to this point,
each polygon we've drawn in X-Sharp has been a single, solid color. Over
the last couple of chapters we added the ability to shade polygons
according to lighting, but each polygon was still a single color. Thus,
in order to produce any sort of intricate design, a great many tiny
polygons would have to be drawn. That would be very slow, so we need
another approach. One such approach is texture mapping; that is, mapping
the bitmap containing the desired image onto the pixels contained within
the transformed polygon. Done properly, this should make it possible to
change X-Sharp's output from a bland collection of monocolor facets to a
lively, detailed, and much more realistic scene.

"What sort of scene?" you may well ask. This is where Pooh and the space
station came in. When I sat down to think of a sample texture-mapping
application, it occurred to me that the shaded ball demo we added to
X-Sharp recently looked at least a bit like a spinning, spherical space
station, and that the single unshaded, yellow polygon looked somewhat
like a window in the space station, and it might be a nice example if
someone were standing in the window....

The rest is history.

### Principles of Quick-and-Dirty Texture Mapping

The key to our texture-mapping approach will be to quickly determine
what pixel value to draw for each pixel in the transformed destination
polygon. These polygon pixel values will be determined by mapping each
destination pixel in the transformed polygon back to the image bitmap,
via a reverse transformation, and seeing what color resides at the
corresponding location in the image bitmap, as shown in Figure 56.1. It
might seem more intuitive to map pixels the other way, from the image
bitmap to the transformed polygon, but in fact it's crucial that the
mapping proceed backward from the destination to avoid gaps in the final
image. With the approach of finding the right value for each destination
pixel in turn, via a backward mapping, there's no way we can miss any
destination pixels. On the other hand, with the forward-mapping method,
some destination pixels may be skipped or double-drawn, because this is
not necessarily a one-to-one or one-to-many mapping. Although we're not
going to take advantage of it now, mapping back to the source makes it
possible to average several neighboring image pixels together to
calculate the value for each destination pixel; that is, to antialias
the image. This can greatly improve texture quality, although it is
slower.

![**Figure 56.1**  *Using reverse transformation to find the source pixel
color.*](../images/56-01.jpg)

#### Mapping Textures Made Easy

To understand how we're going to map textures, consider Figure 56.2,
which maps a bitmapped image directly onto an untransformed polygon.
Here, we simply map the origin of the polygon's untransformed coordinate
system somewhere within the image, then map the vertices to the
corresponding image pixels. (For simplicity, I'll assume in this
discussion that the polygon's coordinate system is in units of pixels,
but scaling images to polygons is eminently doable. This will become
clearer when we look at mapping images onto transformed polygons, next.)
Mapping the image to the polygon is then a simple matter of stepping one
scan line at a time in both the image and the polygon, each time
advancing the X coordinates of the edges according to the slopes of the
lines, just as is normally done when filling a polygon. Since the
polygon is untransformed, the stepping is identical in both the image
and the polygon, and the pixel mapping is one-to-one, so the appropriate
part of each scan line of the image can simply be block copied to the
destination.

![**Figure 56.2**  *Mapping a texture onto an untransformed polygon.*](../images/56-02.jpg)

Now, matters get more complicated. What if the destination polygon is
rotated in two dimensions? We no longer have a neat direct mapping from
image scan lines to destination polygon scan lines. We still want to
draw across each destination scan line, but the proper source pixels for
each destination scan line may now track across the source bitmap at an
angle, as shown in Figure 56.3. What can we do?

The solution is remarkably simple. We'll just map each transformed
vertex to the corresponding vertex in the bitmap; this is easy, because
the vertices are at the same indices in the original and transformed
vertex lists. Each time we select a new edge to scan for the destination
polygon, we'll select the corresponding edge in the source bitmap, as
well. Then—and this is crucial—each time we step a destination edge one
scan line, we'll step the corresponding source image edge an equivalent
amount.

Ah, but what is an "equivalent amount"? Think of it this way. If a
destination edge is 100 scan lines high, it will be stepped 100 times.
Then, we'll divide the `SourceXWidth` and `SourceYHeight` lengths of
the source edge by 100, and add those amounts to the source edge's
coordinates each time the destination is stepped one scan line. Put
another way, we have, as usual, arranged things so that in the
destination polygon we step `DestYHeight` times, where `DestYHeight`
is the height of the destination edge. The this approach arranges to
step the source image edge `DestYHeight` times also, to match what the
destination is doing.

![**Figure 56.3**  *Mapping a texture onto a 2-D rotated polygon.*](../images/56-03.jpg)

Now we're able to track the coordinates of the polygon edges through the
source image in tandem with the destination edges. Stepping across each
destination scan line uses precisely the same technique, as shown in
Figure 56.4. In the destination, we step `DestXWidth` times across
each scan line of the polygon, once for each pixel on the scan line.
(`DestXWidth` is the horizontal distance between the two edges being
scanned on any given scan line.) To match this, we divide
`SourceXWidth` and `SourceYHeight` (the lengths of the scan line in
the source image, as determined by the source edge points we've been
tracking, as just described) by the width of the destination scan line,
`DestXWidth`, to produce `SourceXStep` and `SourceYStep`. Then, we
just step `DestXWidth` times, adding `SourceXStep` and
`SourceYStep` to `SourceX` and `SourceY` each time, and choose the
nearest image pixel to (`SourceX`,`SourceY`) to copy to (`DestX`,
`DestY`). (Note that the names used above, such as `SourceXWidth`,
are used for descriptive purposes, and don't necessarily correspond to
the actual variable names used in Listing 56.2.)

That's a workable approach for 2-D rotated polygons—but what about 3-D
rotated polygons, where the visible dimensions of the polygon can vary
with 3-D rotation and perspective projection? First, I'd like to make it
clear that texture mapping takes place from the source image to the
destination polygon after the destination polygon is projected to the
screen. That is, the image will be mapped after the destination polygon
is in its final, drawable form. Given that, it should be apparent that
the above approach automatically compensates for all changes in the
dimensions of a polygon. You see, this approach divides source edges and
scan lines into however many steps the destination polygon requires. If
the destination polygon is much narrower than the source polygon, as a
result of 3-D rotation and perspective projection, we just end up taking
bigger steps through the source image and skipping a lot of source image
pixels, as shown in Figure 56.5. The upshot is that the above approach
handles all transformations and projections effortlessly. It could also
be used to scale source images up to fit in larger polygons; all that's
needed is a list of where the polygon's vertices map into the source
image, and everything else happens automatically. In fact, mapping from
any polygonal area of a bitmap to any destination polygon will work,
given only that the two polygons have the same number of vertices.

![**Figure 56.4**  *Mapping a horizontal destination scan line back to
the source image.*](../images/56-04.jpg)

![**Figure 56.5**  *Mapping a texture onto a narrower polygon.*](../images/56-05.jpg)

#### Notes on DDA Texture Mapping

That's all there is to quick-and-dirty texture mapping. This technique
basically uses a two-stage digital differential analyzer (DDA) approach
to step through the appropriate part of the source image in tandem with
the normal scan-line stepping through the destination polygon, so I'll
call it "DDA texture mapping." It's worth noting that there is no need
for any trigonometric functions at all, and only two divides are
required per scan line.

This isn't a perfect approach, of course. For one thing, it isn't
anywhere near as fast as drawing solid polygons; the speed is more
comparable to drawing each polygon as a series of lines. Also, the DDA
approach results in far from perfect image quality, since source pixels
may be skipped or selected twice. I trust, however, that you can see how
easy it would be to improve image quality by antialiasing with the DDA
approach. For example, we could simply average the four surrounding
pixels as we did for simple, unweighted antialiasing in Chapters F,
G,Chapter K on the companion CD-ROM. Or, we could take a Wu antialiasing
approach (see Chapter 57) and average the two bracketing pixels along
each axis according to proximity. If we had cycles to waste (which,
given that this is real-time animation on a PC, we don't), we could
improve image quality by putting the source pixels through a low-pass
filter sized in X and Y according to the ratio of the source and
destination dimensions (that is, how much the destination is scaled up
or down from the source).

Even more important is that the sort of texture mapping I'll do in
X-Sharp doesn't correct for perspective. That doesn't much matter for
small polygons or polygons that are nearly parallel to the screen in
3-space, but it can produce very noticeable bowing of textures on large
polygons at an angle to the screen. Perspective texture mapping is a
complex subject that's outside the scope of this book, but you should be
aware of its existence, because perspective texture mapping is a key
element of many games these days.

Finally, I'd like to point out that this sort of DDA texture mapping is
display-hardware dependent, because the bitmap for each image must be
compatible with the number of bits per pixel in the destination. That's
actually a fairly serious issue. One of the nice things about X-Sharp's
polygon orientation is that, until now, the only display dependent part
of X-Sharp has been the transformation from RGB color space to the
adapter's color space. Compensation for aspect ratio, resolution, and
the like all happens automatically in the course of projection. Still,
we need the ability to display detailed surfaces, and it's hard to
conceive of a fast way to do so that's totally hardware independent. (If
you know of one, let me know care of the publisher.)

For now, all we need is fast texture mapping of adequate quality, which
the straightforward, non-antialiased DDA approach supplies. I'm sure
there are many other fast approaches, and, as I've said, there are more
accurate approaches, but DDA texture mapping works well, given the
constraints of the PC's horsepower. Next, we'll look at code that
performs DDA texture mapping. First, though, I'd like to take a moment
to thank Jim Kent, author of Autodesk Animator and a frequent
correspondent, for getting me started with the DDA approach.

### Fast Texture Mapping: An Implementation

As you might expect, I've implemented DDA texture mapping in X-Sharp,
and the changes are reflected in the X-Sharp archive in this chapter's
subdirectory on the listings disk. Listing 56.1 shows the new header
file entries, and Listing 56.2 shows the actual texture-mapped polygon
drawer. The set-pixel routine that Listing 56.2 calls is a slight
modification of the Mode X set-pixel routine from Chapter 47. In
addition, INITBALL.C has been modified to create three texture-mapped
polygons and define the texture bitmaps, and modifications have been
made to allow the user to flip the axis of rotation. You will of course
need the complete X-Sharp library to see texture mapping in action, but
Listings 56.1 and 56.2 are the actual texture mapping code in its
entirety.

No matter how you slice it, DDA texture mapping beats boring,
single-color polygons nine ways to Sunday. The big downside is that it's
much slower than a normal polygon fill; move the ball close to the
screen in DEMO1, and watch things slow down when one of those big
texture maps comes around. Of course, that's partly because the code is
all in C; some well-chosen optimizations would work wonders. In the next
chapter we'll discuss texture mapping further, crank up the speed of our
texture mapper, and attend to some rough spots that remain in the DDA
texture mapping implementation, most notably in the area of exactly
which texture pixels map to which destination pixels as a polygon
rotates.

And, in case you're curious, yes, there is a bear in DEMO1. I wouldn't
say he looks much like a Pooh-type bear, but he's a bear nonetheless. He
does tend to look a little startled when you flip the ball around so
that he's zipping by on his head, but, heck, you would too in the same
situation. And remember, when you buy the next VGA megahit, *Bears in
Space*, you saw it here first.
