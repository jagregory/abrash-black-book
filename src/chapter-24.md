## Chapter 24 -- Parallel Processing with the VGA

### Taking on Graphics Memory Four Bytes at a Time

This heading refers to the ability of the VGA chip to manipulate up to
four bytes of display memory at once. In particular, the VGA provides
four ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) to assist the CPU during display
memory writes, and this hardware is a tremendous resource in the task of
manipulating the VGA's sizable frame buffer. The ALUs are actually only
one part of the surprisingly complex data flow architecture of the VGA,
but since they're involved in almost all memory access operations,
they're a good place to begin.

### VGA Programming: ALUs and Latches

I'm going to begin our detailed tour of the VGA at the heart of the flow
of data through the VGA: the four ALUs built into the VGA's Graphics
Controller (GC) circuitry. The ALUs (one for each display memory plane)
are capable of ORing, ANDing, and XORing CPU data and display memory
data together, as well as masking off some or all of the bits in the
data from affecting the final result. All the ALUs perform the same
logical operation at any given time, but each ALU operates on a
different display memory byte.

Recall that the VGA has four display memory planes, with one byte in
each plane at any given display memory address. All four display memory
bytes operated on are read from and written to the same address, but
each ALU operates on a byte that was read from a different plane and
writes the result to that plane. This arrangement allows four display
memory bytes to be modified by a single CPU write (which must often be
preceded by a single CPU read, as we will see). The benefit is vastly
improved performance; if the CPU had to select each of the four planes
in turn via `OUT`s and perform the four logical operations itself, VGA
performance would slow to a crawl.

Figure 24.1 is a simplified depiction of data flow around the ALUs. Each
ALU has a matching latch, which holds the byte read from the
corresponding plane during the last CPU read from display memory, even
if that particular plane wasn't the plane that the CPU actually read on
the last read access. (Only one byte can be read by the CPU with a
single display memory read; the plane supplying the byte is selected by
the Read Map register. However, the bytes at the specified address in
all four planes are always read when the CPU reads display memory, and
those four bytes are stored in their respective latches.)

Each ALU logically combines the byte written by the CPU and the byte
stored in the matching latch, according to the settings of bits 3 and 4
of the Data Rotate register (and the Bit Mask register as well, which
I'll cover next time), and then writes the result to display memory. It
is most important to understand that neither ALU operand comes directly
from display memory. The temptation is to think of the ALUs as combining
CPU data and the contents of the display memory address being written
to, but they actually combine CPU data and the contents of the last
display memory location read, which need not be the location being
modified. The most common application of the ALUs is indeed to modify a
given display memory location, but doing so requires a read from that
location to load the latches before the write that modifies it. Omission
of the read results in a write operation that logically combines CPU
data n with whatever data happens to be in the latches from the last
read, which is normally undesirable.

![**Figure 24.1**  *VGA ALU data flow.*](images/24-01.jpg)

Occasionally, however, the independence of the latches from the display
memory location being written to can be used to great advantage. The
latches can be used to perform 4-byte-at-a-time (one byte from each
plane) block copying; in this application, the latches are loaded with a
read from the source area and written unmodified to the destination
area. The latches can be written unmodified in one of two ways: By
selecting write mode 1 (for an example of this, see the last chapter),
or by setting the Bit Mask register to 0 so only the latched bits are
written.

The latches can also be used to draw a fairly complex area fill pattern,
with a different bit pattern used to fill each plane. The mechanism for
this is as follows: First, generate the desired pattern across all
planes at any display memory address. Generating the pattern requires a
separate write operation for each plane, so that each plane's byte will
be unique. Next, read that memory address to store the pattern in the
latches. The contents of the latches can now be written to memory any
number of times by using either write mode 1 or the bit mask, since they
will not change until a read is performed. If the fill pattern does not
require a different bit pattern for each plane—that is, if the pattern
is black and white—filling can be performed more easily by simply
fanning the CPU byte out to all four planes with write mode 0. The
set/reset registers can be used in conjunction with fanning out the data
to support a variety of two-color patterns. More on this in Chapter 25.

The sample program in Listing 24.1 fills the screen with horizontal
bars, then illustrates the operation of each of the four ALU logical
functions by writing a vertical 80-pixel-wide box filled with solid,
empty, and vertical and horizontal bar patterns over that background
using each of the functions in turn. When observing the output of the
sample program, it is important to remember that all four vertical boxes
are drawn with *exactly* the same code—only the logical function that is
in effect differs from box to box.

All graphics in the sample program are done in black-and-white by
writing to all planes, in order to show the operation of the ALUs most
clearly. Selective enabling of planes via the Map Mask register and/or
set/reset would produce color effects; in that case, the operation of
the logical functions must be evaluated on a plane-by-plane basis, since
only the enabled planes would be affected by each operation.

Logical function 0, which writes the CPU data unmodified, is the
standard mode of operation of the ALUs. In this mode, the CPU data is
combined with the latched data by ignoring the latched data entirely.
Expressed as a logical function, this could be considered CPU data ANDed
with 1 (or ORed with 0). This is the mode to use whenever you want to
place CPU data into display memory, replacing the previous contents
entirely. It may occur to you that there is no need to latch display
memory at all when the data unmodified function is selected. In the
sample program, that is true, but if the bit mask is being used, the
latches must be loaded even for the data unmodified function, as I'll
discuss in the next chapter.

Logical functions 1 through 3 cause the CPU data to be ANDed, ORed, and
XORed with the latched data, respectively. Of these, XOR is the most
useful, since exclusive-ORing is a traditional way to perform animation.
The uses of the AND and OR logical functions are less obvious. AND can
be used to mask a blank area into display memory, or to mask off those
portions of a drawing operation that don't overlap an existing display
memory image. OR could conceivably be used to force an image into
display memory over an existing image. To be honest, I haven't
encountered any particularly valuable applications for AND and OR, but
they're the sort of building-block features that could come in handy in
just the right context, so keep them in mind.

### Notes on the ALU/Latch Demo Program

VGA settings such as the logical function select should be restored to
their default condition before the BIOS is called to output text or draw
pixels. The VGA BIOS does not guarantee that it will set most VGA
registers except on mode sets, and there are so many compatible BIOSes
around that the code of the IBM BIOS is not a reliable guide. For
instance, when the BIOS is called to draw text, it's likely that the
result will be illegible if the Bit Mask register is not in its default
state. Similarly, a mode set should generally be performed before
exiting a program that tinkers with VGA settings.

Along the same lines, the sample program does not explicitly set the Map
Mask register to ensure that all planes are enabled for writing. The
mode set for mode 10H leaves all planes enabled, so I did not bother to
program the Map Mask register, or any other register besides the Data
Rotate register, for that matter. However, the profusion of compatible
BIOSes means there is some small risk in relying on the BIOS to leave
registers set properly. For the highly safety-conscious, the best course
would be to program data control registers such as the Map Mask and Read
Mask explicitly before relying on their contents.

On the other hand, any function the BIOS provides explicitly—as part of
the interface specification—such as setting the palette RAM, should be
used in preference to programming the hardware directly whenever
possible, because the BIOS may mask hardware differences between VGA
implementations.

The code that draws each vertical box in the sample program reads from
display memory immediately before writing to display memory. The read
operation loads the VGA latches. The value that is read is irrelevant as
far as the sample program is concerned. The read operation is present
only because it is necessary to perform a read to load the latches, and
there is no way to read without placing a value in a register. This is a
bit of a nuisance, since it means that the value of some 8-bit register
must be destroyed. Under certain circumstances, a single logical
instruction such as `XOR` or `AND` can be used to perform both the
read to load the latches and then write to modify display memory without
affecting any CPU registers, as we'll see later on.

All text in the sample program is drawn by VGA BIOS function 13H, the
write string function. This function is also present in the AT's BIOS,
but not in the XT's or PC's, and as a result is rarely used; the
function is always available if a VGA is installed, however. Text drawn
with this function is relatively slow. If speed is important, a program
can draw text directly into display memory much faster in any given
display mode. The great virtue of the BIOS write string function in the
case of the VGA is that it provides an uncomplicated way to get text on
the screen reliably in any mode and color, over any background.

The expression used to load DX in the `TEXT_UP` macro in the sample
program may seem strange, but it's a convenient way to save a byte of
program code and a few cycles of execution time. DX is being loaded with
a word value that's composed of two independent immediate byte values.
The obvious way to implement this would be with

```nasm
MOV DL,VALUE1
MOV DH,VALUE2
```
which requires four instruction bytes. By shifting the value destined
for the high byte into the high byte with MASM's shift-left operator,
`SHL` (\*100H would work also), and then logically combining the
values with MASM's `OR` operator (or the `ADD` operator), both
halves of DX can be loaded with a single instruction, as in

```nasm
MOV DX,(VALUE2 SHL 8) OR VALUE1
```

which takes only three bytes and is faster, being a single instruction.
(Note, though, that in 32-bit protected mode, there's a size and
performance penalty for 16-bit instructions such as the `MOV` above;
see the first part of this book for details.) As shown, a macro is an
ideal place to use this technique; the macro invocation can refer to two
separate byte values, making matters easier for the programmer, while
the macro itself can combine the values into a single word-sized
constant.

The latches and ALUs are central to high-performance VGA code, since
they allow programs to process across all four memory planes without a
series of `OUT`s and read/write operations. It is not always easy to
arrange a program to exploit this power, however, because the ALUs are
far more limited than a CPU. In many instances, however, additional
hardware in the VGA, including the bit mask, the set/reset features, and
the barrel shifter, can assist the ALUs in controlling data, as we'll
see in the next few chapters.
