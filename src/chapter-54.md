## Chapter 54 -- 3-D Shading

### Putting Realistic Surfaces on Animated 3-D Objects

At the end of the previous chapter, X-Sharp had just acquired basic
hidden-surface capability, and performance had been vastly improved
through the use of fixed-point arithmetic. In this chapter, we're going
to add quite a bit more: support for 8088 and 80286 PCs, a general color
model, and shading. That's an awful lot to cover in one chapter
(actually, it'll spill over into the next chapter), so let's get to it!

### Support for Older Processors

To date, X-Sharp has run on only the 386 and 486, because it uses 32-bit
multiply and divide instructions that sub-386 processors don't support.
I chose 32-bit instructions for two reasons: They're much faster for
16.16 fixed-point arithmetic than any approach that works on the 8088
and 286; and they're much easier to implement than any other approach.
In short, I was after maximum performance, and I was perhaps just a
little lazy.

I should have known better than to try to sneak this one by you. The
most common feedback I've gotten on X-Sharp is that I should make it
support the 8088 and 286. Well, I can take a hint as well as the next
guy. Listing 54.1 is an improved version of FIXED.ASM, containing dual
386/8088 versions of `CosSin(), XformVec()`, and `ConcatXforms()`,
as well as `FixedMul()` and `FixedDiv()`.

Given the new version of FIXED.ASM, with `USE386` set to 0, X-Sharp
will now run on any processor. That's not to say that it will run fast
on any processor, or at least not as fast as it used to. The switch to
8088 instructions makes X-Sharp's fixed-point calculations about 2.5
times slower overall. Since a PC is perhaps 40 times slower than a
486/33, we're talking about a hundred-times speed difference between the
low end and mainstream. A 486/33 can animate a 72-sided ball, complete
with shading (as discussed later), at 60 frames per second (fps), with
plenty of cycles to spare; an 8-MHz AT can animate the same ball at
about 6 fps. Clearly, the level of animation an application uses must be
tailored to the available CPU horsepower.

The implementation of a 32-bit multiply using 8088 instructions is a
simple matter of adding together four partial products. A 32-bit divide
is not so simple, however. In fact, in Listing 54.1 I've chosen not to
implement a full 32x32 divide, but rather only a 32x16 divide. The
reason is simple: performance. A 32x16 divide can be implemented on an
8088 with two `DIV` instructions, but a 32x32 divide takes a great
deal more work, so far as I can see. (If anyone has a fast 32x32 divide,
or has a faster way to handle signed multiplies and divides than the
approach taken by Listing 54.1, please drop me a line care of the
publisher.) In X-Sharp, division is used only to divide either X or Y by
Z in the process of projecting from view space to screen space, so the
cost of using a 32x16 divide is merely some inaccuracy in calculating
screen coordinates, especially when objects get very close to the Z = 0
plane. This error is not cumulative (that is, it doesn't carry over to
later frames), and in my experience doesn't cause noticeable image
degradation; therefore, given the already slow performance of the 8088
and 286, I've opted for performance over precision.

At any rate, please keep in mind that the non-386 version of
`FixedDiv()` is *not* a general-purpose 32x32 fixed-point division
routine. In fact, it will generate a divide-by-zero error if passed a
fixed-point divisor between -1 and 1. As I've explained, the non-386
version of `Fixed-Div()` is designed to do just what X-Sharp needs,
and no more, as quickly as possible.

 ;NOTE!!! Non-386 division uses a 32-bit dividend but only the upper 16 bits
 ; of the divisor; in other words, only the integer part of the divisor is
 ; used. This is done so that the division can be accomplished with two fast
 ; hardware divides instead of a slow software implementation, and is (in my
 ; opinion) acceptable because division is only used to project points to the
 ; screen (normally, the divisor is a Z coordinate), so there's no cumulative
 ; error, although there will be some error in pixel placement (the magnitude
 ; of the error is less the farther away from the Z=0 plane objects are). This
 ; is *not* a general-purpose divide, though; if the divisor is less than 1,
 ; for instance, a divide-by-zero error will result! For this reason, non-386
 ; projection can't be performed for points closer to the viewpoint than Z=1.

#### Shading

So far, the polygons out of which our animated objects have been built
have had colors of fixed intensities. For example, a face of a cube
might be blue, or green, or white, but whatever color it is, that color
never brightens or dims. Fixed colors are easy to implement, but they
don't make for very realistic animation. In the real world, the
intensity of the color of a surface varies depending on how brightly it
is illuminated. The ability to simulate the illumination of a surface,
or shading, is the next feature we'll add to X-Sharp.

The overall shading of an object is the sum of several types of shading
components. *Ambient shading* is illumination by what you might think of
as background light, light that's coming from all directions; all
surfaces are equally illuminated by ambient light, regardless of their
orientation. *Directed lighting*, producing diffuse shading, is
illumination from one or more specific light sources. Directed light has
a specific direction, and the angle at which it strikes a surface
determines how brightly it lights that surface. *Specular reflection* is
the tendency of a surface to reflect light in a mirrorlike fashion.
There are other sorts of shading components, including transparency and
atmospheric effects, but the ambient and diffuse-shading components are
all we're going to deal with in X-Sharp.

#### Ambient Shading

The basic model for both ambient and diffuse shading is a simple one.
Each surface has a reflectivity between 0 and 1, where 0 means all light
is absorbed and 1 means all light is reflected. A certain amount of
light energy strikes each surface. The energy (intensity) of the light
is expressed such that if light of intensity 1 strikes a surface with
reflectivity 1, then the brightest possible shading is displayed for
that surface. Complicating this somewhat is the need to support color;
we do this by separating reflectance and shading into three components
each—red, green, and blue—and calculating the shading for each color
component separately for each surface.

Given an ambient-light red intensity of IA~red~ and a surface red
reflectance R~red~, the displayed red ambient shading for that surface,
as a fraction of the maximum red intensity, is simply min(IA~red~x
R~red~, 1). The green and blue color components are handled similarly.
That's really all there is to ambient shading, although of course we
must design some way to map displayed color components into the
available palette of colors; I'll do that in the next chapter. Ambient
shading isn't the whole shading picture, though. In fact, scenes tend to
look pretty bland without diffuse shading.

#### Diffuse Shading

Diffuse shading is more complicated than ambient shading, because the
effective intensity of directed light falling on a surface depends on
the angle at which it strikes the surface. According to Lambert's law,
the light energy from a directed light source striking a surface is
proportional to the cosine of the angle at which it strikes the surface,
with the angle measured relative to a vector perpendicular to the
polygon (a polygon normal), as shown in Figure 54.1. If the red
intensity of directed light is ID~red~, the red reflectance of the
surface is R~red~, and the angle between the incoming directed light and
the surface's normal is theta, then the displayed red diffuse shading
for that surface, as a fraction of the largest possible red intensity,
is min (ID~red~xR~red~xcos(θ), 1).

That's easy enough to calculate—but seemingly slow. Determining the
cosine of an angle can be sped up with a table lookup, but there's also
the task of figuring out the angle, and, all in all, it doesn't seem
that diffuse shading is going to be speedy enough for our purposes.
Consider this, however: According to the properties of the dot product
(denoted by the operator "•", as shown in Figure 54.2), cos(q)=(v•w)/
|v| x |w| ), where v and w are vectors, q is the angle between v and w,
and |v| is the length of v. Suppose, now, that v and w are unit vectors;
that is, vectors exactly one unit long. Then the above equation reduces
to cos(q)=v•w. In other words, we can calculate the cosine between N,
the unit-normal vector (one-unit-long perpendicular vector) of a
polygon, and L', the reverse of a unit vector describing the direction
of a light source, with just three multiplies and two adds. (I'll
explain why the light-direction vector must be reversed later.) Once we
have that, we can easily calculate the red diffuse shading from a
directed light source as min(ID~red~xR~red~x(L'• N), 1) and likewise for
the green and blue color components.

![**Figure 54.1**  *Illumination by a directed light source*](../images/54-01.jpg)

![**Figure 54.2**  *The dot product of two vectors.*](../images/54-02.jpg)

The overall red shading for each polygon can be calculated by summing
the ambient-shading red component with the diffuse-shading component
from each light source, as in min((IA~red~xR~red~) +
(ID~red0~xR~red~x(L~0~' • N)) + (ID~red1~xR~red~x(L~1~' • N)) +..., 1)
where ID~red0~ and L~0~' are the red intensity and the reversed
unit-direction vector, respectively, for spotlight 0. Listing 54.2 shows
the X-Sharp module DRAWPOBJ.C, which performs ambient and diffuse
shading. Toward the end, you will find the code that performs shading
exactly as described by the above equation, first calculating the
ambient red, green, and blue shadings, then summing that with the
diffuse red, green, and blue shadings generated by each directed light
source.

#### Shading: Implementation Details

In order to calculate the cosine of the angle between an incoming light
source and a polygon's unit normal, we must first have the polygon's
unit normal. This could be calculated by generating a cross-product on
two polygon edges to generate a normal, then calculating the normal's
length and scaling to produce a unit normal. Unfortunately, that would
require taking a square root, so it's not a desirable course of action.
Instead, I've made a change to X-Sharp's polygon format. Now, the first
vertex in a shaded polygon's vertex list is the end-point of a unit
normal that starts at the second point in the polygon's vertex list, as
shown in Figure 54.3. The first point isn't one of the polygon's
vertices, but is used only to generate a unit normal. The second point,
however, is a polygon vertex. Calculating the difference vector between
the first and second points yields the polygon's unit normal. Adding a
unit-normal endpoint to each polygon isn't free; each of those
end-points has to be transformed, along with the rest of the vertices,
and that takes time. Still, it's faster than calculating a unit normal
for each polygon from scratch.

![**Figure 54.4**  *The reversed light source vector.*](../images/54-04.jpg)

We also need a unit vector for each directed light source. The directed
light sources I've implemented in X-Sharp are spotlights; that is,
they're considered to be point light sources that are infinitely far
away. This allows the simplifying assumption that all light rays from a
spotlight are parallel and of equal intensity throughout the displayed
universe, so each spotlight can be represented with a single unit vector
and a single intensity. The only trick is that in order to calculate the
desired cos(theta) between the polygon unit normal and a spotlight's
unit vector, the direction of the spotlight's unit vector must be
reversed, as shown in Figure 54.4. This is necessary because the dot
product implicitly places vectors with their start points at the same
location when it's used to calculate the cosine of the angle between two
vectors. The light vector is incoming to the polygon surface, and the
unit normal is outbound, so only by reversing one vector or the other
will we get the cosine of the desired angle.

Given the two unit vectors, it's a piece of cake to calculate
intensities, as shown in Listing 54.2. The sample program DEMO1, in the
X-Sharp archive on the listings disk (built by running K1.BAT), puts the
shading code to work displaying a rotating ball with ambient lighting
and three spot lighting sources that the user can turn on and off. What
you'll see when you run DEMO1 is that the shading is very good—face
colors change very smoothly indeed—so long as only green lighting
sources are on. However, if you combine spotlight two, which is blue,
with any other light source, polygon colors will start to shift abruptly
and unevenly. As configured in the demo, the palette supports a wide
range of shading intensities for a pure version of any one of the three
primary colors, but a very limited number of intensity steps (four, in
this case) for each color component when two or more primary colors are
mixed. While this situation can be improved, it is fundamentally a
result of the restricted capabilities of the 256-color palette, and
there is only so much that can be done without a larger color set. In
the next chapter, I'll talk about some ways to improve the quality of
256-color shading.
