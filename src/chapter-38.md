## Chapter 38 -- The Polygon Primeval

### Drawing Polygons Efficiently and Quickly

*"Give me but one firm spot on which to stand, and I will move the
Earth."*

—Archimedes

Were Archimedes alive today, he might say, "Give me but one fast
polygon-fill routine on which to call, and I will draw the Earth."
Programmers often think of pixel drawing as being the basic graphics
primitive, but filled polygons are equally fundamental and far more
useful. Filled polygons can be used for constructs as diverse as a
single pixel or a 3-D surface, and virtually everything in between.

I'll spend some time in this chapter and the next several developing
routines to draw filled polygons and building more sophisticated
graphics operations atop those routines. Once we have that foundation,
I'll get into 2-D manipulation and animation of polygon-based entities
as preface to an exploration of 3-D graphics. You can't get there from
here without laying some groundwork, though, so in this chapter I'll
begin with the basics of filling a polygon. In the next chapter, we'll
see how to draw a polygon considerably faster. That's my general
approach for this sort of topic: High-level exploration of a graphics
topic first, followed by a speedy hardware-specific implementation for
the IBM PC/VGA combination, the most widely used graphics system around.
Abstract, machine-independent graphics is a thing of beauty, but only by
understanding graphics at all levels, including the hardware, can you
boost performance into the realm of the sublime.

And slow computer graphics is scarcely worth the bother.

### Filled Polygons

A polygon is simply a shape formed by lines laid end to end to form a
continuous, closed path. A polygon is filled by setting all pixels
within the polygon's boundaries to a color or pattern. For now, we'll
work only with polygons filled with solid colors.

You can divide polygons into three categories: convex, nonconvex, and
complex, as shown in Figure 38.1. Convex polygons include what you'd
normally think of as "convex" and more; as far as we're concerned, a
convex polygon is one for which any horizontal line drawn through the
polygon encounters the right edge exactly once and the left edge exactly
once, excluding horizontal and zero-length edge segments. Put another
way, neither the right nor left edge of a convex polygon ever reverses
direction from up to down, or vice-versa. Also, the right and left edges
of a convex polygon may not cross one another, although they may touch
so long as the right edge never crosses over to the left side of the
left edge. (Check out the second polygon drawn in Listing 38.3, which
certainly isn't convex in the normal sense.) The boundaries of nonconvex
polygons, on the other hand, can go in whatever directions they please,
so long as they never cross. Complex polygons can have any boundaries
you might imagine, which makes for interesting problems in deciding
which interior spaces to fill and which not to fill. Each category is a
superset of the previous one.

(See Chapter 41 for a more detailed discussion of polygon types and
naming.)

Why bother to distinguish between convex, nonconvex, and complex
polygons? Easy: performance, especially when it comes to filling convex
polygons. We're going to start with filled convex polygons; they're
widely useful and will serve well to introduce some of the subtler
complexities of polygon drawing, not the least of which is the slippery
concept of "inside."

#### Which Side Is Inside?

The basic principle of polygon filling is decomposing each polygon into
a series of horizontal lines, one for each horizontal row of pixels, or
scan line, within the polygon (a process I'll call *scan conversion*),
and drawing the horizontal lines. I'll refer to the entire process as
rasterization. Rasterization of convex polygons is easily done by
starting at the top of the polygon and tracing down the left and right
sides, one scan line (one vertical pixel) at a time, filling the extent
between the two edges on each scan line, until the bottom of the polygon
is reached. At first glance, rasterization does not seem to be
particularly complicated, although it should be apparent that this
simple approach is inadequate for nonconvex polygons.

![**Figure 38.1**  *Convex, nonconvex, and complex polygons.*](../images/38-01.jpg)

There are a couple of complications, however. The lesser complication is
how to rasterize the polygon efficiently, given that it's difficult to
write fast code that simultaneously traces two edges and fills the space
between them. The solution is to decouple the process of scan-converting
the polygon into a list of horizontal lines from that of drawing the
horizontal lines. One device-independent routine can trace along the two
edges and build a list of the beginning and end coordinates of the
polygon on each raster line. Then a second, device-specific, routine can
draw from the list after the entire polygon has been scanned. We'll see
this in action shortly.

The second, greater complication arises because the definition of which
pixels are "within" a polygon is a more complicated matter than you
might imagine. You might think that scan-converting an edge of a polygon
is analogous to drawing a line from one vertex to the next, but this is
not so. A line by itself is a one-dimensional construct, and as such is
approximated on a display by drawing the pixels nearest to the line on
either side of the true line. A line serving as a polygon boundary, on
the other hand, is part of a two-dimensional object. When filling a
polygon, we want to draw the pixels within the polygon, but a standard
vertex-to-vertex line-drawing algorithm will draw many pixels outside
the polygon, as shown in Figure 38.2.

It's no crime to use standard lines to trace out a polygon, rather than
drawing only interior pixels. In fact, there are certain advantages: For
example, the edges of a filled polygon will match the edges of the same
polygon drawn unfilled. Such polygons will look pretty much as they're
supposed to, and all drawing on raster displays is, after all, only an
approximation of an ideal.

![**Figure 38.2**  *Drawing polygons with standard line-drawing
algorithms.*](../images/38-02.jpg)

There's one great drawback to tracing polygons with standard lines,
however: Adjacent polygons won't fit together properly, as shown in
Figure 38.3. If you use six equilateral triangles to make a hexagon, for
example, the edges of the triangles will overlap when traced with
standard lines, and more recently drawn triangles will wipe out portions
of their predecessors. Worse still, odd color effects will show up along
the polygon boundaries if XOR drawing is used. Consequently, filling out
to the boundary lines just won't do for drawing images composed of
fitted-together polygons. And because fitting polygons together is
exactly what I have in mind, we need a different approach.

#### How Do You Fit Polygons Together?

How, then, do you fit polygons together? *Very* carefully. First, the
line-tracing algorithm must be adjusted so that it selects only those
pixels that are truly inside the polygon. This basically requires
shifting a standard line-drawing algorithm horizontally by one
half-pixel toward the polygon's interior. That leaves the issue of how
to handle points that are exactly on the boundary, and points that lie
at vertices, so that those points are drawn once and only once. To deal
with that, we're going to adopt the following rules:

  * Points located exactly on nonhorizontal edges are drawn only if the
    interior of the polygon is directly to the right (left edges are
    drawn, right edges aren't).

    ![**Figure 38.3**  *The adjacent polygons problem.*](../images/38-03.jpg)

  * Points located exactly on horizontal edges are drawn only if the
    interior of the polygon is directly below them (horizontal top edges
    are drawn, horizontal bottom edges aren't).
  * A vertex is drawn only if all lines ending at that point meet the
    above conditions (no right or bottom edges end at that point).

All edges of a polygon except those that are flat tops or flat bottoms
will be considered either right edges or left edges, regardless of
slope. The left edge is the one that starts with the leftmost line down
from the top of the polygon.

These rules ensure that no pixel is drawn more than once when adjacent
polygons are filled, and that if polygons cover the full 360-degree
range around a pixel, then that pixel will be drawn once and only
once—just what we need in order to be able to fit filled polygons
together seamlessly.

For our purposes, nonoverlapping polygons are the way to go, so let's
have at them.

### Filling Non-Overlapping Convex Polygons

Without further ado, Listing 38.1 contains a function,
`FillConvexPolygon`, that accepts a list of points that describe a
convex polygon, with the last point assumed to connect to the first, and
scans it into a list of lines to fill, then passes that list to the
function `DrawHorizontalLineList` in Listing 38.2. Listing 38.3 is a
sample program that calls `FillConvexPolygon` to draw polygons of
various sorts, and Listing 38.4 is a header file included by the other
listings. Here are the listings; we'll pick up discussion on the other
side.

**LISTING 38.1 L38-1.C**

```c
/* Color-fills a convex polygon. All vertices are offset by (XOffset,
  YOffset). "Convex" means that every horizontal line drawn through
  the polygon at any point would cross exactly two active edges
  (neither horizontal lines nor zero-length edges count as active
  edges; both are acceptable anywhere in the polygon), and that the
  right & left edges never cross. (It's OK for them to touch, though,
  so long as the right edge never crosses over to the left of the
  left edge.) Nonconvex polygons won't be drawn properly. Returns 1
  for success, 0 if memory allocation failed. */

Listing 38.2 isn't particularly interesting; it merely draws each
horizontal line in the passed-in list in the simplest possible way, one
pixel at a time. (No, that doesn't make the pixel the fundamental
primitive; in the next chapter I'll replace Listing 38.2 with a much
faster version that doesn't bother with individual pixels at all.)

Listing 38.1 is where the action is in this chapter. Our goal is to scan
out the left and right edges of each polygon so that all points inside
and no points outside the polygon are drawn, and so that all points
located exactly on the boundary are drawn only if they are not on right
or bottom edges. That's precisely what Listing 38.1 does. Here's how:

Listing 38.1 first finds the top and bottom of the polygon, then works
out from the top point to find the two ends of the top edge. If the ends
are at different locations, the top is flat, which has two implications.
First, it's easy to find the starting vertices and directions through
the vertex list for the left and right edges. (To scan-convert them
properly, we must first determine which edge is which.) Second, the top
scan line of the polygon should be drawn without the rightmost pixel,
because only the rightmost pixel of the horizontal edge that makes up
the top scan line is part of a right edge.

If, on the other hand, the ends of the top edge are at the same
location, the top is pointed. In that case, the top scan line of the
polygon isn't drawn; it's part of the right-edge line that starts at the
top vertex. (It's part of a left-edge line, too, but the right edge
overrides.) When the top isn't flat, it's more difficult to tell in
which direction through the vertex list the right and left edges go,
because both edges start at the top vertex. The solution is to compare
the slopes from the top vertex to the ends of the two lines coming out
of it in order to see which is leftmost. The calculations in Listing
38.1 involving the various deltas do this, using a rearranged form of
the slope-based equation:

    (DeltaYN/DeltaXN)>(DeltaYP/DeltaXP)

Once we know where the left edge starts in the vertex list, we can
scan-convert it a line segment at a time until the bottom vertex is
reached. Each point is stored as the starting X coordinate for the
corresponding scan line in the list we'll pass to
`DrawHorizontalLineList`. The nearest X coordinate on each scan line
that's on or to the right of the left edge is selected. The last point
of each line segment making up the left edge isn't scan-converted,
producing two desirable effects. First, it avoids drawing each vertex
twice; two lines come into every vertex, but we want to scan-convert
each vertex only once. Second, not scan-converting the last point of
each line causes the bottom scan line of the polygon not to be drawn, as
required by our rules. The first scan line of the polygon is also
skipped if the top isn't flat.

Now we need to scan-convert the right edge into the ending X coordinate
fields of the line list. This is performed in the same manner as for the
left edge, except that every line in the right edge is moved one pixel
to the left before being scan-converted. Why? We want the nearest point
to the left of but not on the right edge, so that the right edge itself
isn't drawn. As it happens, drawing the nearest point on or to the right
of a line moved one pixel to the left is exactly the same as drawing the
nearest point to the left of but not on that line in its original
location. Sketch it out and you'll see what I mean.

Once the two edges are scan-converted, the whole line list is passed to
`DrawHorizontalLineList`, and the polygon is drawn.

Finis.

### Oddball Cases

Listing 38.1 handles zero-length segments (multiple vertices at the same
location) by ignoring them, which will be useful down the road because
scaled-down polygons can end up with nearby vertices moved to the same
location. Horizontal line segments are fine anywhere in a polygon, too.
Basically, Listing 38.1 scan-converts between active edges (the edges
that define the extent of the polygon on each scan line) and both
horizontal and zero-length lines are non-active; neither advances to
another scan line, so they don't affect the edges being scanned.

I've limited this chapter's code to merely demonstrating the principles
of filling convex polygons, and the listings given are by no means fast.
In the next chapter, we'll spice things up by eliminating the floating
point calculations and pixel-at-a-time drawing and tossing a little
assembly language into the mix.
