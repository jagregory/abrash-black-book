### The Joys and Galling Problems of Using Split Screens on the EGA and VGA

The ability to split the screen into two largely independent portions
one—displayed above the other on the screen—is one of the more
intriguing capabilities of the VGA and EGA. The split screen feature can
be used for popups (including popups that slide smoothly onto the
screen), or simply to display two separate portions of display memory on
a single screen. While it's possible to accomplish the same effects
purely in software without using the split screen, software solutions
tend to be slow and hard to implement.

By contrast, the basic operation of the split screen is fairly simple,
once you grasp the various coding tricks required to pull it off, and
understand the limitations and pitfalls—like the fact that the EGA's
split screen implementation is a little buggy. Furthermore, panning with
the split screen enabled is not as simple as it might seem. All in all,
we do have some ground to cover.

Let's start with the basic operation of the split screen.

### How the Split Screen Works

The *operation* of the split screen is simplicity itself. A split screen
start scan line value is programmed into two EGA registers or three VGA
registers. (More on exactly which registers in a moment.) At the
beginning of each frame, the video circuitry begins to scan display
memory for video data starting at the address specified by the start
address registers, just as it normally would. When the video circuitry
encounters the specified split screen start scan line in the course of
scanning video data onto the screen, it completes that scan line
normally, then resets the internal pointer which addresses the next byte
of display memory to be read for video data to zero. Display memory from
address zero onward is then scanned for video data in the usual way,
progressing toward the high end of memory. At the end of the frame, the
pointer to the next byte of display memory to scan is reloaded from the
start address registers, and the whole process starts over.

The net effect: The contents of display memory starting at offset zero
are displayed starting at the scan line following the specified split
screen start scan line, as shown in Figure 30.1. It's important to
understand that the scan line that matches the split screen scan line is
*not* part of the split screen; the split screen starts on the
*following* scan line. So, for example, if the split screen scan line is
set to zero, the split screen actually starts at scan line 1, the second
scan line from the top of the screen.

If both the start address and the split screen start scan line are set
to 0, the data at offset zero in display memory is displayed as both the
first scan line on the screen *and* the second scan line. There is no
way to make the split screen cover the entire screen—it always comes up
at least one scan line short.

![**Figure 30.1**  *Display memory and the split screen.*](../images/30-01.jpg)

So, where is the split screen start scan line stored? The answer varies
a bit, depending on whether you're talking about the EGA or the VGA. On
the EGA, the split screen start scan line is a 9-bit value, with bits
7-0 stored in the Line Compare register (CRTC register 18H) and bit 8
stored in bit 4 of the Overflow register (CRTC register 7). Other bits
in the Overflow register serve as the high bits of other values, such as
the vertical total and the vertical blanking start. Since EGA registers
are—alas!—not readable, you must know the correct settings for the other
bits in the Overflow registers to use the split screen on an EGA.
Fortunately, there are only two standard Overflow register settings on
the EGA: 11H for 200-scan-line modes and 1FH for 350-scan-line modes.

The VGA, of course, presents no such problem in setting the split screen
start scan line, for it has readable registers. However, the VGA
supports a 10-bit split screen start scan line value, with bits 8-0
stored just as with the EGA, and bit 9 stored in bit 6 of the Maximum
Scan Line register (CRTC register 9).

Turning the split screen on involves nothing more than setting all bits
of the split screen start scan line to the scan line after which you
want the split screen to start appearing. (Of course, you'll probably
want to change the start address before using the split screen;
otherwise, you'll just end up displaying the memory at offset zero
*twice:* once in the normal screen and once in the split screen.)
Turning off the split screen is a simple matter of setting the split
screen start scan line to a value equal to or greater than the last scan
line displayed; the safest such approach is to set all bits of the split
screen start scan line to 1. (That is, in fact, the split screen start
scan line value programmed by the BIOS during a mode set.)

#### The Split Screen in Action

All of these points are illustrated by Listing 30.1. Listing 30.1 fills
display memory starting at offset zero (the split screen area of memory)
with text identifying the split screen, fills display memory starting at
offset 8000H with a graphics pattern, and sets the start address to
8000H. At this point, the normal screen is being displayed (the split
screen start scan line is still set to the BIOS default setting, with
all bits equal to 1, so the split screen is off), with the pixels based
on the contents of display memory at offset 8000H. The contents of
display memory between offset 0 and offset 7FFFH are not visible at all.

Listing 30.1 then slides the split screen up from the bottom of the
screen, one scan line at a time. The split screen slides halfway up the
screen, bounces down a quarter of the screen, advances another
half-screen, drops another quarter-screen, and finally slides all the
way up to the top. If you've never seen the split screen in action, you
should run Listing 30.1; the smooth overlapping of the split screen on
top of the normal display is a striking effect.

Listing 30.1 isn't done just yet, however. After a keypress, Listing
30.1 demonstrates how to turn the split screen off (by setting all bits
of the split screen start scan line to 1). After another keypress,
Listing 30.1 shows that the split screen can never cover the whole
screen, by setting the start address to 0 and then flipping back and
forth between the normal screen and the split screen with a split screen
start scan line setting of zero. Both the normal screen and the split
screen display the same text, but the split screen displays it one scan
line lower, because the split screen doesn't start until *after* the
first scan line, and that produces a jittering effect as the program
switches the split screen on and off. (On the EGA, the split screen may
display *two* scan lines lower, for reasons I'll discuss shortly.)

Finally, after another keypress, Listing 30.1 halts.

#### VGA and EGA Split-Screen Operation Don't Mix

You must set the `IS_VGA` equate at the start of Listing 30.1 
correctly for the adapter the code will run on in order for the program
to perform properly. This equate determines how the upper bits of the
split screen start scan line are set by `SetSplitScreenRow`. If
`IS_VGA` is 0 (specifying an EGA target), then bit 8 of the split
screen start scan line is set by programming the entire Overflow
register to 1FH; this is hard-wired for the 350-scan-line modes of the
EGA. If `IS_VGA` is 1 (specifying a VGA target), then bits 8 and 9 of
the split screen start scan line are set by reading the registers they
reside in, changing only the split-screen-related bits, and writing the
modified settings back to their respective registers.

The VGA version of Listing 30.1 won't work on an EGA, because EGA
registers aren't readable. The EGA version of Listing 30.1 won't work on
a VGA, both because VGA monitors require different vertical settings
than EGA monitors and because the EGA version doesn't set bit 9 of the
split screen start scan line. In short, there is no way that I know of
to support both VGA and EGA split screens with common code; separate
drivers are required. This is one of the reasons that split screens are
so rarely used in PC programming.

By the way, Listing 30.1 operates in mode 10H because that's the
highest-resolution mode the VGA and EGA share. That's not the only mode
the split screen works in, however. In fact, it works in *all* modes, as
we'll see later.

### Setting the Split-Screen-Related Registers

Setting the split-screen-related registers is not as simple a matter as
merely outputting the right values to the right registers; timing is
also important. The split screen start scan line value is checked
against the number of each scan line as that scan line is displayed,
which means that the split screen start scan line potentially takes
effect the moment it is set. In other words, if the screen is displaying
scan line 15 and you set the split screen start to 16, that change will
be picked up immediately and the split screen will start after the next
scan line. This is markedly different from changes to the start address,
which take effect only at the start of the next frame.

The instantly-effective nature of the split screen is a bit of a
problem, not because the changed screen appears as soon as the new split
screen start scan line is set—that seems to me to be an advantage—but
because the changed screen can appear *before* the new split screen
start scan line is set.

The solution is simple: Set the split screen start scan line at a time
when it can't possibly match the currently displayed scan line. The easy
way to do that is to set it when there isn't any currently displayed
scan line—during vertical non-display time. One safe time that's easy to
find is the start of the vertical sync pulse, which is typically pretty
near the middle of vertical non-display time, and that's the approach
I've followed in Listing 30.1. I've also disabled interrupts during the
period when the split screen registers are being set. This isn't
absolutely necessary, but if it's not done, there's the possibility that
an interrupt will occur between register sets and delay the later
register sets until display time, again causing flicker.

One interesting effect of setting the split screen registers at the
start of vertical sync is that it has the effect of synchronizing the
program to the display adapter's frame rate. No matter how fast the
computer running Listing 30.1 may be, the split screen will move at a
maximum rate of once per frame. This is handy for regulating execution
speed over a wide variety of hardware performance ranges; however, be
aware that the VGA supports 70 Hz frame rates in all non-480-scan-line
modes, while the VGA in 480-scan-line-modes and the EGA in all color
modes support 60 Hz frame rates.

### The Problem with the EGA Split Screen

I mentioned earlier that the EGA's split screen is a little buggy. How?
you may well ask, particularly given that Listing 30.1 illustrates that
the EGA split screen seems pretty functional.

The bug is this: The first scan line of the EGA split screen—the scan
line starting at offset zero in display memory—is displayed not once but
twice. In other words, the first line of split screen display memory,
and only the first line, is replicated one unnecessary time, pushing all
the other lines down by one.

That's not a fatal bug, of course. In fact, if the first few scan lines
are identical, it's not even noticeable. The EGA's split-screen bug can
produce visible distortion given certain patterns, however, so you
should try to make the top few lines identical (if possible) when
designing split-screen images that might be displayed on EGAs, and you
should in any case check how your split-screens look on both VGAs and
EGAs.

There's another respect in which the EGA is inferior to the VGA when it
comes to the split screen, and that's in the area of panning when the
split screen is on. This isn't a bug—it's just one of the many areas in
which the VGA's designers learned from the shortcomings of the EGA and
went the EGA one better.

### Split Screen and Panning

Back in Chapter 23, I presented a program that performed smooth
horizontal panning. Smooth horizontal panning consists of two parts:
byte-by-byte (8-pixel) panning by changing the start address and
pixel-by-pixel intrabyte panning by setting the Pel Panning register (AC
register 13H) to adjust alignment by 0 to 7 pixels. (IBM prefers its own
jargon and uses the word "pel" instead of "pixel" in much of their
documentation, hence "pel panning." Then there's DASD, a.k.a. Direct
Access Storage Device—IBM-speak for hard disk.)

Horizontal smooth panning works just fine, although I've always harbored
some doubts that any one horizontal-smooth-panning approach works
properly on all display board clones. (More on this later.) There's a
catch when using horizontal smooth panning with the split screen up,
though, and it's a serious catch: You can't byte-pan the split screen
(which always starts at offset zero, no matter what the setting of the
start address registers)—but you *can* pel-pan the split screen.

Put another way, when the normal portion of the screen is horizontally
smooth-panned, the split screen portion moves a pixel at a time until
it's time to move to the next byte, then jumps back to the start of the
current byte. As the top part of the screen moves smoothly about, the
split screen will move and jump, move and jump, over and over. Believe
me, it's not a pretty sight.

> ![](../images/i.jpg)

On the VGA, there is recourse. A VGA-only bit, bit 5 of the AC Mode
Control register (AC register 10H), turns off pel panning in the split
screen. In other words, when this bit is set to 1, pel panning is reset
to zero before the first line of the split screen, and remains zero
until the end of the frame. This doesn't allow you to pan the split
screen horizontally, mind you—there's no way to do that—but it does let
you pan the normal screen while the split screen stays rock-solid. This
can be used to produce an attractive "streaming tape" effect in the
normal screen while the split screen is used to display non-moving
information.

#### The Split Screen and Horizontal Panning: An Example

Listing 30.2 illustrates the interaction of horizontal smooth panning
with the split screen, as well as the suppression of pel panning in the
split screen. Listing 30.2 creates a virtual screen 1024 pixels across
by setting the Offset register (CRTC register 13H) to 64, sets the
normal screen to scan video data beginning far enough up in display
memory to leave room for the split screen starting at offset zero, turns
on the split screen, and fills in the normal screen and split screen
with distinctive patterns. Next, Listing 30.2 pans the normal screen
horizontally without setting bit 5 of the AC Mode Control register to 1.
As you'd expect, the split screen jerks about quite horribly. After a
key press, Listing 30.2 sets bit 5 of the Mode Control register and pans
the normal screen again. This time, the split screen doesn't budge an
inch—*if* the code is running on a VGA.

By the way, if `IS_VGA` is set to 0 in Listing 30.2, the program will
assemble in a form that will run on the EGA and *only* the EGA. Pel
panning suppression in the split screen won't work in this version,
however, because the EGA lacks the capability to support that feature.
When the EGA version runs, the split screen simply jerks back and forth
during both panning sessions.

**LISTING 30.2 L30-2.ASM**

```nasm
; Demonstrates the interaction of the split screen and
; horizontal pel panning. On a VGA, first pans right in the top
; half while the split screen jerks around, because split screen
; pel panning suppression is disabled, then enables split screen
; pel panning suppression and pans right in the top half while the
; split screen remains stable. On an EGA, the split screen jerks
; around in both cases, because the EGA doesn't support split

;
; The jerking in the split screen occurs because the split screen

### Notes on Setting and Reading Registers

There are a few interesting points regarding setting and reading
registers to be made about Listing 30.2. First, bit 5 of the AC Index
register should be set to 1 whenever palette RAM is not being set (which
is to say, all the time in your code, because palette RAM should
normally be set via the BIOS). When bit 5 is 0, video data from display
memory is no longer sent to palette RAM, and the screen becomes a solid
color—not normally a desirable state of affairs.

Recall also that the AC Index and Data registers are both written to at
I/O address 3C0H, with the toggle that determines which one is written
to at any time switching state on every write to 3C0H; this toggle is
reset to index mode by each read from the Input Status 0 register (3DAH
in color modes, 3BAH in monochrome modes). The AC Index and Data
registers can also be written to at 3C1H on the EGA, but not on the VGA,
so steer clear of that practice.

On the VGA, reading AC registers is a bit different from writing to
them. The AC Data register can be read from 3C0H, and the AC register
currently addressed by the AC Index register can be read from 3C1H;
reading does not affect the state of the AC index/data toggle. Listing
30.2 illustrates reading from and writing to the AC registers. Finally,
setting the start address registers (CRTC registers 0CH and 0DH) has its
complications. As with the split screen registers, the start address
registers must be set together and without interruption at a time when
there's no chance of a partial setting being used for a frame. However,
it's a little more difficult to know when that might be the case with
the start address registers than it was with the split screen registers,
because it's not clear when the start address is used.

You see, the start address is loaded into the EGA's or VGA's internal
display memory pointer once per frame. The internal pointer is then
advanced, byte-by-byte and line-by-line, until the end of the frame
(with a possible resetting to zero if the split screen line is reached),
and is then reloaded for the next frame. That's straightforward enough;
the real question is, *Exactly when is the start address loaded?*

In his excellent book *Programmer's Guide to PC Video Systems*
(Microsoft Press) Richard Wilton says that the start address is loaded
at the start of the vertical sync pulse. (Wilton calls it vertical
retrace, which can also be taken to mean vertical non-display time, but
given that he's testing the vertical sync status bit in the Input Status
0 register, I assume he means that the start address is loaded at the
start of vertical sync.) Consequently, he waits until the *end* of the
vertical sync pulse to set the start address registers, confident that
the start address won't take effect until the next frame.

I'm sure Richard is right when it comes to the real McCoy IBM VGA and
EGA, but I'm less confident that every clone out there loads the start
address at the start of vertical sync.

The interaction of the start address registers and the Pel Panning
register is worthy of note. After waiting for the end of vertical sync
to set the start address in Listing 30.2, I wait for the start of the
*next* vertical sync to set the Pel Panning register. That's because the
start address doesn't take effect until the start of the next frame, but
the pel panning setting takes effect at the start of the next line; if
we set the pel panning at the same time we set the start address, we'd
get a whole frame with the old start address and the new pel panning
settings mixed together, causing the screen to jump. As with the split
screen registers, it's safest to set the Pel Panning register during
non-display time. For maximum reliability, we'd have interrupts off from
the time we set the start address registers to the time we change the
pel planning setting, to make sure an interrupt doesn't come in and
cause us to miss the start of a vertical sync and thus get a mismatched
pel panning/start address pair for a frame, although for modularity I
haven't done this in Listing 30.2. (Also, doing so would require
disabling interrupts for much too long a time.)

What if you wanted to pan faster? Well, you could of course just move
two pixels at a time rather than one; I assure you no one will ever
notice when you're panning at a rate of 10 or more times per second.

### Split Screens in Other Modes

So far we've only discussed the split screen in mode 10H. What about
other modes? Generally, the split screen works in any mode; the basic
rule is that when a scan line on the screen matches the split screen
scan line, the internal display memory pointer is reset to zero. I've
found this to be true even in oddball modes, such as line-doubled CGA
modes and the 320x200 256-color mode (which is really a 320x400 mode
with each line repeated. For split-screen purposes, the VGA and EGA seem
to count purely in scan lines, not in rows or doubled scan lines or the
like. However, I have run into small anomalies in those modes on clones,
and I haven't tested all modes (nor, lord knows, all clones!) so be
careful when using the split screen in modes other than modes 0DH-12H,
and test your code on a variety of hardware.

Come to think of it, I warn you about the hazards of running fancy VGA
code on clones pretty often, don't I? Ah, well—just one of the hazards
of the diversity and competition of the PC market! It is a fact of life,
though—if you're a commercial developer and don't test your video code
on at least half a dozen VGAs, you're living dangerously.

What of the split screen in text mode? It works fine; in fact, it not
only resets the internal memory pointer to zero, but also resets the
text scan line counter—which marks which line within the font you're
on—to zero, so the split screen starts out with a full row of text.
There's only one trick with text mode: When split screen pel panning
suppression is on, the pel panning setting is forced to 0 for the rest
of the frame. Unfortunately, 0 is *not* the "no-panning" setting for
9-dot-wide text; 8 is. The result is that when you turn on split screen
pel panning suppression, the text in the split screen won't pan with the
normal screen, as intended, but will also display the undesirable
characteristic of moving one pixel to the left. Whether this causes any
noticeable on-screen effects depends on the text displayed by a
particular application; for example, there should be no problem if the
split screen has a border of blanks on the left side.

### How Safe?

So, how safe *is* it to use the split screen? My opinion is that it's
perfectly safe, although I'd welcome input from people with extensive
split screen experience—and the effects are striking enough that the
split screen is well worth using in certain applications.

I'm a little more leery of horizontal smooth scrolling, with or without
the split screen. Still, the Wilton book doesn't advise any particular
caution, and I haven't heard any horror stories from the field lately,
so the clone manufacturers must finally have gotten it right. (I vividly
remember some early clones years back that *didn't* quite get it right.)
So, on balance, I'd say to use horizontal smooth scrolling if you really
need it; on the other hand, in fast animation you can often get away
with byte scrolling, which is easier, faster, and safer. (I recently saw
a game that scrolled as smoothly as you could ever want. It was only by
stopping it with Ctrl-NumLock that I was able to be sure that it was, in
fact, byte panning, not pel panning.)

In short, use the fancy stuff—but only when you have
