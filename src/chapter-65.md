## Chapter 65 -- 3-D Clipping and Other Thoughts

### Determining What's Inside Your Field of View

Our part of the world is changing, and I'm concerned. By way of
explanation, three anecdotes.

Anecdote the first: In the introduction to one of his books, Frank
Herbert, author of *Dune*, told how he had once been approached by a
friend who claimed he (the friend) had a killer idea for an SF story,
and offered to tell it to Herbert. In return, Herbert had to agree that
if he used the idea in a story, he'd split the money from the story with
this fellow. Herbert's response was that ideas were a dime a dozen; he
had more story ideas than he could ever write in a lifetime. The hard
part was the writing, not the ideas.

Anecdote the second: I've been programming micros for 15 years, and
writing about them for more than a decade and, until about a year ago, I
had never—not once!—had anyone offer to sell me a technical idea. In the
last year, it's happened multiple times, generally via unsolicited email
along the lines of Herbert's tale.

This trend toward selling ideas is one symptom of an attitude that I've
noticed more and more among programmers over the past few years—an
attitude of which software patents are the most obvious manifestation—a
desire to think something up without breaking a sweat, then let someone
else's hard work make you money. It's an attitude that says, "I'm so
smart that my ideas alone set me apart." Sorry, it doesn't work that way
in the real world. Ideas are a dime a dozen in programming, too; I have
a lifetime's worth of article and software ideas written neatly in a
notebook, and I know several truly original thinkers who have far more
yet. Folks, it's not the ideas; it's design, implementation, and
especially hard work that make the difference.

Virtually every idea I've encountered in 3-D graphics was invented
decades ago. You think you have a clever graphics idea? Sutherland,
Sproull, Schumacker, Catmull, Smith, Blinn, Glassner, Kajiya, Heckbert,
or Teller probably thought of your idea years ago. (I'm serious—spend a
few weeks reading through the literature on 3-D graphics, and you'll be
amazed at what's already been invented and published.) If they thought
it was important enough, they wrote a paper about it, or tried to
commercialize it, but what they didn't do was try to charge people for
the idea itself.

A closely related point is the astonishing lack of gratitude some
programmers show for the hard work and sense of community that went into
building the knowledge base with which they work. How about this? Anyone
who thinks they have a unique idea that they want to "own" and milk for
money can do so—but first they have to track down and appropriately
compensate all the people who made possible the compilers, algorithms,
programming courses, books, hardware, and so forth that put them in a
position to have their brainstorm.

Put that way, it sounds like a silly idea, but the idea behind software
patents is precisely that eventually everyone will own parts of our
communal knowledge base, and that programming will become in large part
a process of properly identifying and compensating each and every owner
of the techniques you use. All I can say is that if we do go down that
path, I guarantee that it will be a poorer profession for all of
us—except the patent attorneys, I guess.

Anecdote the third: A while back, I had the good fortune to have lunch
down by Seattle's waterfront with Neal Stephenson, the author of *Snow
Crash* and *The Diamond Age* (one of the best SF books I've come across
in a long time). As he talked about the nature of networked technology
and what he hoped to see emerge, he mentioned that a couple of blocks
down the street was the pawn shop where Jimi Hendrix bought his first
guitar. His point was that if a cheap guitar hadn't been available,
Hendrix's unique talent would never have emerged. Similarly, he views
the networking of society as a way to get affordable creative tools to
many people, so as much talent as possible can be unearthed and
developed.

Extend that to programming. The way it should work is that a steady flow
of information circulates, so that everyone can do the best work they're
capable of. The idea is that I don't gain by intellectually
impoverishing you, and vice-versa; as we both compete and (intentionally
or otherwise) share ideas, both our products become better, so the
market grows larger and everyone benefits.

That's the way things have worked with programming for a long time. So
far as I can see it has worked remarkably well, and the recent signs of
change make me concerned about the future of our profession.

Things aren't changing *everywhere*, though; over the past year, I've
circulated a good bit of info about 3-D graphics, and plan to keep on
doing it as long as I can. Next, we're going to take a look at 3-D
clipping.

### 3-D Clipping Basics

Before I got deeply into 3-D, I kept hearing how difficult 3-D clipping
was, so I was pleasantly surprised when I actually got around to doing
it and found that it was quite straightforward, after all. At heart, 3-D
clipping is nothing more than evaluating whether and where a line
intersects a plane; in this context, the plane is considered to have an
"inside" (a side on which points are to be kept) and an "outside" (a
side on which points are to be removed or clipped). We can easily extend
this single operation to polygon clipping, working with the line
segments that form the edges of a polygon.

The most common application of 3-D clipping is as part of the process of
hidden surface removal. In this application, the four planes that make
up the view volume, or view frustum, are used to clip away parts of
polygons that aren't visible. Sometimes this process includes clipping
to near and far plane, to restrict the depth of the scene. Other
applications include clipping to splitting planes while building BSP
trees, and clipping moving objects to convex sectors such as BSP leaves.
The clipping principles I'll cover apply to any sort of 3-D clipping
task, but clipping to the frustum is the specific context in which I'll
discuss clipping below.

In a commercial application, you wouldn't want to clip every single
polygon in the scene database individually. As I mentioned in the last
chapter, the use of bounding volumes to cull chunks of the scene
database that fall entirely outside the frustum, without having to
consider each polygon separately, is an important performance aspect of
scene rendering. Once that's done, however, you're still left with a set
of polygons that may be entirely inside, or partially or completely
outside, the frustum. In this chapter, I'm going to talk about how to
clip those remaining polygons. I'll focus on the basics of 3-D clipping,
the stuff I wish I'd known when I started doing 3-D. There are plenty of
ways to speed up clipping under various circumstances, some of which
I'll mention, but the material covered below will give you the tools you
need to implement functional 3-D clipping.

#### Intersecting a Line Segment with a Plane

The fundamental 3-D clipping operation is clipping a line segment to a
plane. There are two parts to this operation: determining if the line is
clipped by (intersects) the plane at all and, if it is clipped,
calculating the point of intersection.

Before we can intersect a line segment with a plane, we must first
define how we'll represent the line segment and the plane. The segment
will be represented in the obvious way by the (x,y,z) coordinates of its
two endpoints; this extends well to polygons, where each vertex is an
(x,y,z) point. Planes can be described in many ways, among them are
three points on the plane, a point on the plane and a unit normal, or a
unit normal and a distance from the origin along the normal; we'll use
the latter definition. Further, we'll define the normal to point to the
inside (unclipped side) of the plane. The structures for points,
polygons, and planes are shown in Listing 65.1.

**LISTING 65.1 L65\_1.h**

```c
typedef struct {
    double v[3];
} point_t;

typedef struct {
    double   x, y;
} point2D_t;

typedef struct {
    int         color;
    int         numverts;
    point_t     verts[MAX_POLY_VERTS];
} polygon_t;

typedef struct {
    int         color;
    int         numverts;
    point2D_t   verts[MAX_POLY_VERTS];
} polygon2D_t;

typedef struct convexobject_s {
    struct convexobject_s   *pnext;
    point_t                 center;
    double                  vdist;
    int                     numpolys;
    polygon_t               *ppoly;
} convexobject_t;

typedef struct {
    double  distance;
    point_t normal;
} plane_t;
```

Given a line segment, and a plane to which to clip the segment, the
first question is whether the segment is entirely on the inside or the
outside of the plane, or intersects the plane. If the segment is on the
inside, then the segment is not clipped by the plane, and we're done. If
it's on the outside, then it's entirely clipped, and we're likewise
done. If it intersects the plane, then we have to remove the clipped
portion of the line by replacing the endpoint on the outside of the
plane with the point of intersection between the line and the plane.

The way to answer this question is to find out which side of the plane
each endpoint is on, and the dot product is the right tool for the job.
As you may recall from Chapter 61, dotting any vector with a unit normal
returns the length of the projection of that vector onto the normal.
Therefore, if we take any point and dot it with the plane normal we'll
find out how far from the origin the point is, as measured along the
plane normal. Another way to think of this is to say that the dot
product of a point and the plane normal returns how far from the origin
along the normal the plane would have to be in order to have the point
lie within the plane, as if we slid the plane along the normal until it
touched the point.

Now, remember that our definition of a plane is a unit normal and a
distance along the normal. That means that we have a distance for the
plane as part of the plane structure, and we can get the distance at
which the plane would have to be to touch the point from the dot product
of the point and the normal; a simple comparison of the two values
suffices to tell us which side of the plane the point is on. If the dot
product of the point and the plane normal is greater than the plane
distance, then the point is in front of the plane (inside the volume
being clipped to); if it's less, then the point is outside the volume
and should be clipped.

After we do this twice, once for each line endpoint, we know everything
necessary to categorize our line segment. If both endpoints are on the
same side of the plane, there's nothing more to do, because the line is
either completely inside or completely outside; otherwise, it's on to
the next step, clipping the line to the plane by replacing the outside
vertex with the point of intersection of the line and the plane.
Happily, it turns out that we already have all of the information we
need to do this.

From our earlier tests, we already know the length from the plane,
measured along the normal, to the inside endpoint; that's just the
distance, along the normal, of the inside endpoint from the origin (the
dot product of the endpoint with the normal), minus the plane distance,
as shown in Figure 65.1. We also know the length of the line segment,
again measured as projected onto the normal; that's the difference
between the distances along the normal of the inside and outside
endpoints from the origin. The ratio of these two lengths is the
fraction of the segment that remains after clipping. If we scale the x,
y, and z lengths of the line segment by that fraction, and add the
results to the inside endpoint, we get a new, clipped endpoint at the
point of intersection.

### Polygon Clipping

Line clipping is fine for wireframe rendering, but what we really want
to do is polygon rendering of solid models, which requires polygon
clipping. As with line segments, the clipping process with polygons is
to determine if they're inside, outside, or partially inside the clip
volume, lopping off any vertices that are outside the clip volume and
substituting vertices at the intersection between the polygon and the
clip plane, as shown in Figure 65.2.

An easy way to clip a polygon is to decompose it into a set of edges,
and clip each edge separately as a line segment. Let's define a polygon
as a set of vertices that wind clockwise around the outside of the
polygonal area, as viewed from the front side of the polygon; the edges
are implicitly defined by the order of the vertices. Thus, an edge is
the line segment described by the two adjacent vertices that form its
endpoints. We'll clip a polygon by clipping each edge individually,
emitting vertices for the resulting polygon as appropriate, depending on
the clipping state of the edge. If the start point of the edge is
inside, that point is added to the output polygon. Then, if the start
and end points are in different states (one inside and one outside), we
clip the edge to the plane, as described above, and add the point at
which the line intersects the clip plane as the next polygon vertex, as
shown in Figure 65.3. Listing 65.2 shows a polygon-clipping function.

**LISTING 65.2 L65\_2.c**

```c
int ClipToPlane(polygon_t *pin, plane_t *pplane, polygon_t *pout)
{
    int     i, j, nextvert, curin, nextin;
    double  curdot, nextdot, scale;
    point_t *pinvert, *poutvert;

    pinvert = pin->verts;
    poutvert = pout->verts;

    curdot = DotProduct(pinvert, &pplane->normal);
    curin = (curdot >= pplane->distance);

    for (i=0 ; i<pin->numverts ; i++)
    {
        nextvert = (i + 1) % pin->numverts;

        // Keep the current vertex if it's inside the plane
        if (curin)
            *poutvert++ = *pinvert;

        nextdot = DotProduct(&pin->verts[nextvert], &pplane->normal);
        nextin = (nextdot >= pplane->distance);

        // Add a clipped vertex if one end of the current edge is
        // inside the plane and the other is outside
        if (curin != nextin)
        {
            scale = (pplane->distance - curdot) /
                    (nextdot - curdot);
            for (j=0 ; j<3 ; j++)
            {
                poutvert->v[j] = pinvert->v[j] +
                    ((pin->verts[nextvert].v[j] - pinvert->v[j]) *
                     scale);
            }
            poutvert++;
        }

        curdot = nextdot;
        curin = nextin;
        pinvert++;
    }

    pout->numverts = poutvert - pout->verts;
    if (pout->numverts < 3)
        return 0;

    pout->color = pin->color;
    return 1;
}
```

Believe it or not, this technique, applied in turn to each edge, is all
that's needed to clip a polygon to a plane. Better yet, a polygon can be
clipped to multiple planes by repeating the above process once for each
clip plane, with each interation trimming away any part of the polygon
that's clipped by that particular plane.

One particularly useful aspect of 3-D clipping is that if you're drawing
texture mapped polygons, texture coordinates can be clipped in exactly
the same way as (x,y,z) coordinates. In fact, the very same fraction
that's used to advance x, y, and z from the inside point to the point of
intersection with the clip plane can be used to advance the texture
coordinates as well, so only one extra multiply and one extra add are
required for each texture coordinate.

#### Clipping to the Frustum

Given a polygon-clipping function, it's easy to clip to the frustum: set
up the four planes for the sides of the frustum, with another one or two
planes for near and far clipping, if desired; next, clip each
potentially visible polygon to each plane in turn; then draw whatever
polygons emerge from the clipping process. Listing 65.3 is the core code
for a simple 3-D clipping example that allows you to move around and
look at polygonal models from any angle. The full code for this program
is available on the CD-ROM in the file DDJCLIP.ZIP.

#### The Lessons of Listing 65.3

There are several interesting points to Listing 65.3. First,
floating-point arithmetic is used throughout the clipping process. While
it is possible to use fixed-point, doing so requires considerable care
regarding range and precision. Floating-point is much easier—and, with
the Pentium generation of processors, is generally comparable in speed.
In fact, for some operations, such as multiplication in general and
division when the floating-point unit is in single-precision mode,
floating-point is much faster. Check out Chris Hecker's column in the
February 1996 *Game Developer* for an interesting discussion along these
lines.

Second, the planes that form the frustum are shifted ever so slightly
inward from their proper positions at the edge of the field of view.
This guarantees that it's never possible to generate a visible vertex
exactly at the eyepoint, averting the divide-by-zero error that such a
vertex would cause when projected and at no performance cost.

Third, the orientation of the viewer relative to the world is specified
via yaw, pitch, and roll angles, successively applied in that order.
These angles are accumulated from frame to frame according to user
input, and for each frame are used to rotate the view up, view right,
and viewplane normal vectors, which define the world coordinate system,
into the viewspace coordinate system; those transformed vectors in turn
define the rotation from worldspace to viewspace. (See Chapter 61 for a
discussion of coordinate systems and rotation, and take a look at
Chapters 5 and 6 of *Computer Graphics*, by Foley and van Dam, for a
broader overview.) One attractive aspect of accumulating angular
rotations that are then applied to the coordinate system vectors is that
there is no deterioration of the rotation matrix over time. This is in
contrast to my X-Sharp package, in which I accumulated rotations by
keeping a cumulative matrix of all the rotations ever performed;
unfortunately, that approach caused roundoff error to accumulate, so
objects began to warp visibly after many rotations.

Fourth, Listing 65.3 processes each input polygon into a clipped
polygon, one line segment at a time. It would be more efficient to
process all the vertices, categorizing whether and how they're clipped,
and then perform a test such as the Cohen-Sutherland outcode test to
detect trivial acceptance (the polygon is entirely inside) and sometimes
trivial rejection (the polygon is fully outside) without ever dealing
with the edges, and to identify which planes actually need to be clipped
against, as discussed in "Line-Segment Clipping Revisited," *Dr. Dobb's
Journal*, January 1996. Some clipping approaches also minimize the
number of intersection calculations when a segment is clipped by
multiple planes. Further, Listing 65.3 clips a polygon against each
plane in turn, generating a new output polygon for each plane; it is
possible and can be more efficient to generate the final, clipped
polygon without any intermediate representations. For further reading on
advanced clipping techniques, see the discussion starting on page 271 of
Foley and van Dam.

Finally, clipping in Listing 65.3 is performed in worldspace, rather
than in viewspace. The frustum is backtransformed from viewspace (where
it is defined, since it exists relative to the viewer) to worldspace for
this purpose. Worldspace clipping allows us to transform only those
vertices that are visible, rather than transforming all vertices into
viewspace, then clipping them. However, the decision whether to clip in
worldspace or viewspace is not clear-cut and is affected by several
factors.

### Advantages of Viewspace Clipping

Although viewspace clipping requires transforming vertices that may not
be drawn, it has potential performance advantages. For example, in
worldspace, near and far clip planes are just additional planes that
have to be tested and clipped to, using dot products. In viewspace, near
and far clip planes are typically planes with constant z coordinates, so
testing whether a vertex is near or far-clipped can be performed with a
single z compare, and the fractional distance along a line segment to a
near or far clip intersection can be calculated with a couple of z
subtractions and a divide; no dot products are needed.

Similarly, if the field of view is exactly 90 degrees, so the frustum
planes go out at 45 degree angles relative to the viewplane, then x==z
and y==z along the clip planes. This means that the clipping status of a
vertex can be determined with a simple comparison, far more quickly than
the standard dot-product test. This lends itself particularly well to
outcode-based clipping algorithms, since each compare can set one
outcode bit.

For a game, 90 degrees is a pretty good field of view, but can we get
the same sort of efficient clipping if we need some other field of view?
Sure. All we have to do is scale the x and y results of the
world-to-view transformation to account for the field of view, so that
the coordinates lie in a viewspace that's normalized such that the
frustum planes extend along lines of x==z and y==z. The resulting
visible projected points span the range -1 to 1 (before scaling up to
get pixel coordinates), just as with a 90-degree field of view, so the
rest of the drawing pipeline remains unchanged. Better yet, there is no
cost in performance because the adjustment can be added to the
transformation matrix.

I didn't implement normalized clipping in Listing 65.3 because I wanted
to illustrate the general 3-D clipping mechanism without additional
complications, and because for many applications the dot product (which,
after all, takes only 10-20 cycles on a Pentium) is sufficient. However,
the more frustum clipping you're doing, especially if most of the
polygons are trivially visible, the more attractive the performance
advantages of normalized clipping become.

### Further Reading

You now have the basics of 3-D clipping, but because fast clipping is
central to high-performance 3-D, there's a lot more to be learned. One
good place for further reading is Foley and van Dam; another is
*Procedural Elements of Computer Graphics*, by David F. Rogers. Read and
understand either of these books, and you'll know everything you need
for world-class clipping.

And, as you read, you might take a moment to consider how wonderful it
is that anyone who's interested can tap into so much expert knowledge
for the price of a book—or, on the Internet, for free—with no strings
attached. Our part of the world is a pretty good place right now, isn't
it?
