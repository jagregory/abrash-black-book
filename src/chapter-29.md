## Chapter 29 -- Saving Screens and Other VGA Mysteries

### Useful Nuggets from the VGA Zen File

There are a number of VGA graphics topics that aren't quite involved
enough to warrant their own chapters, yet still cause a fair amount of
programmer headscratching—and thus deserve treatment somewhere in this
book. This is the place, and during the course of this chapter we'll
touch on saving and restoring 16-color EGA and VGA screens, the
16-out-of-64 colors issue, and techniques involved in reading and
writing VGA control registers.

That's a lot of ground to cover, so let's get started!

### Saving and Restoring EGA and VGA Screens

The memory architectures of EGAs and VGAs are similar enough to treat
both together in this regard. The basic principle for saving EGA and VGA
16-color graphics screens is astonishingly simple: Write each plane to
disk separately. Let's take a look at how this works in the EGA's hi-res
mode 10H, which provides 16 colors at 640x350.

All we need do is enable reads from plane 0 and write the 28,000 bytes
of plane 0 that are displayed in mode 10H to disk, then enable reads
from plane 1 and write the displayed portion of that plane to disk, and
so on for planes 2 and 3. The result is a file that's 112,000 (28,000 \*
4) bytes long, with the planes stored as four distinct 28,000-byte
blocks, as shown in Figure 29.1.

The program shown later on in Listing 29.1 does just what I've described
here, putting the screen into mode 10H, putting up some bittext so there
is something to save, and creating the 112K file SNAPSHOT.SCR, which
contains the visible portion of the mode 10H frame buffer.

![**Figure 29.1**  *Saving EGA/VGA display memory.*](../images/29-01.jpg)

The only part of Listing 29.1 that's even remotely tricky is the use of
the Read Map register (Graphics Controller register 4) to make each of
the four planes of display memory readable in turn. The same code is
used to write 28,000 bytes of display memory to disk four times, and
28,000 bytes of memory starting at A000:0000 are written to disk each
time; however, a different plane is read each time, thanks to the
changing setting of the Read Map register. (If this is unclear, refer
back to Figure 29.1; you may also want to reread Chapter 28 to brush up
on the operation of the Read Map register in particular and reading EGA
and VGA memory in general.)

Of course, we'll want the ability to restore what we've saved, and
Listing 29.2 does this. Listing 29.2 reverses the action of Listing
29.1, selecting mode 10H and then loading 28,000 bytes from SNAPSHOT.SCR
into each plane of display memory. The Map Mask register (Sequence
Controller register 2) is used to select the plane to be written to. If
your computer is slow enough, you can see the colors of the text change
as each plane is loaded when Listing 29.2 runs. Note that Listing 29.2
does not itself draw any text, but rather simply loads the bit map saved
by Listing 29.1 back into the mode 10H frame buffer.

If you compare Listings 29.1 and 29.2, you will see that the Map Mask
register setting used to load a given plane does not match the Read Map
register setting used to read that plane. This is so because while only
one plane can ever be read at a time, anywhere from zero to four planes
can be written to at once; consequently, Read Map register settings are
plane selections from 0 to 3, while Map Mask register settings are plane
*masks* from 0 to 15, where a bit 0 setting of 1 enables writes to plane
0, a bit 1 setting of 1 enables writes to plane 1, and so on. Again,
Chapter 28 provides a detailed explanation of the differences between
the Read Map and Map Mask registers.

Screen saving and restoring is pretty simple, eh? There are a few
caveats, of course, but nothing serious. First, the adapter's registers
must be programmed properly in order for screen saving and restoring to
work. For screen saving, you must be in read mode 0; if you're in color
compare mode, there's no telling what bit pattern you'll save, but it
certainly won't be the desired screen image. For screen restoring, you
must be in write mode 0, with the Bit Mask register set to 0FFH and Data
Rotate register set to 0 (no data rotation and the logical function set
to pass the data through unchanged).

What's the solution? Frankly, the solution is to get VGA-specific. A TSR
designed for the VGA can simply read out and save the state of the
registers of interest, program those registers as needed, save the
screen image, and restore the original settings. From a programmer's
perspective, readable registers are certainly near the top of the list
of things to like about the VGA! The remaining installed base of EGAs is
steadily dwindling, and you may be able to ignore it as a market today,
as you couldn't even a year or two ago.

If you are going to write a hi-res VGA version of the screen capture
program, be sure to account for the increased size of the VGA's mode 12H
bit map. The mode 12H (640x480) screen uses 37.5K per plane of display
memory, so for mode 12H the displayed screen size equate in Listings
29.1 and 29.2 should be changed to:

    DISPLAYED_SCREEN_SIZEequ(640/8)*480

Similarly, if you're capturing a graphics screen that starts at an
offset other than 0 in the segment at A000H, you must change the memory
offset used by the disk functions to match. You can, if you so desire,
read the start offset of the display memory providing the information
shown on the screen from the Start Address registers (CRT Controller
registers 0CH and 0DH); these registers are readable even on an EGA.

Finally, be aware that the screen capture and restore programs in
Listings 29.1 and 29.2 are only appropriate for EGA/VGA modes 0DH, 0EH,
0FH, 010H, and 012H, since they assume a fourconfiguration of EGA/VGA
memory. In all text modes and in CGA graphics modes, and in VGA modes
11H and 13H as well, display memory can simply be written to disk and
read back as a linear block of memory, just like a normal array.

While Listings 29.1 and 29.2 are written in assembly, the principles
they illustrate apply equally well to high-level languages. In fact,
there's no need for any assembly at all when saving an EGA/VGA screen,
as long as the high-level language you're using can perform direct port
I/O to set up the adapter and can read and write display memory
directly.

### 16 Colors out of 64

How does one produce the 64 colors from which the 16 colors displayed by
the EGA can be chosen? The answer is simple enough: There's a BIOS
function that lets you select the mapping of the 16 possible pixel
values to the 64 possible colors. Let's lay out a bit of background
before proceeding, however.

The EGA sends pixel information to the monitor on 6 pins. This means
that there are 2 to the 6th, or 64 possible colors that an EGA can
generate. However, for compatibility with premonitors, in 200-scan-line
modes Enhanced Color Displaymonitors ignore two of the signals. As a
result, in CGA-compatible modes (modes 4, 5, 6, and the 200-scan-line
versions of modes 0, 1, 2, and 3) you can select from only 16 colors
(although the colors can still be remapped, as described below). If
you're not hooked up to a monitor capable of displaying 350 scan lines
(such as the old IBM Color Display), you can never select from more than
16 colors, since those monitors only accept four input signals. For now,
we'll assume we're in one of the 350-scan line color modes, a group
which includes mode 10H and the 350-scan-line versions of modes 0, 1, 2,
and 3.

Each pixel comes out of memory (or, in text mode, out of the
attribute-handling portion of the EGA) as a 4-bit value, denoting 1 of
16 possible colors. In graphics modes, the 4-bit pixel value is made up
of one bit from each plane, with 8 pixels' worth of data stored at any
given byte address in display memory. Normally, we think of the 4-bit
value of a pixel as being that pixel's color, so a pixel value of 0 is
black, a pixel value of 1 is blue, and so on, as if that's a built-in
feature of the EGA.

Actually, though, the correspondence of pixel values to color is
absolutely arbitrary, depending solely on how the colorportion of the
EGA containing the palette registers is programmed. If you cared to have
color 0 be bright red and color 1 be black, that could easily be
arranged, as could a mapping in which all 16 colors were yellow. What's
more, these mappings affect text-mode characters as readily as they do
graphics-mode pixels, so you could map text attribute 0 to white and
text attribute 15 to black to produce a black on white display, if you
wished.

Each of the 16 palette registers stores the mapping of one of the 16
possible 4-bit pixel values from memory to one of 64 possible 6-bit
pixel values to be sent to the monitor as video data, as shown in Figure
29.2. A 4-bit pixel value of 0 causes the 6-bit value stored in palette
register 0 to be sent to the display as the color of that pixel, a pixel
value of 1 causes the contents of palette register 1 to be sent to the
display, and so on. Since there are only four input bits, it stands to
reason that only 16 colors are available at any one time; since there
are six output bits, however, those 16 colors can be mapped to any of 64
colors. The mapping for each of the 16 pixel values is controlled by the
lower six bits of the corresponding palette register, as shown in Figure
29.3. Secondary red, green, and blue are less-intense versions of red,
green, and blue, although their exact effects vary from monitor to
monitor. The best way to figure out what the 64 colors look like on your
monitor is to see them, and that's just what the program in Listing
29.3, which we'll discuss shortly, lets you do.

![**Figure 29.2**  *Color translation via the palette registers.*](../images/29-02.jpg)

How does one go about setting the palette registers? Well, it's
certainly possible to set the palette registers directly by addressing
them at registers 0 through 0FH of the Attribute Controller. However,
setting the palette registers is a bit tricky—bit 5 of the Attribute
Controller Index register must be 0 while the palette registers are
written to, and glitches can occur if the updating doesn't take place
during the blanking interval—and besides, it turns out that there's no
need at all to go straight to the hardware on this one. Conveniently,
the EGA BIOS provides us with video function 10H, which supports setting
either any one palette register or all 16 palette registers (and the
overscan register as well) with a single video interrupt.

Video function 10H is invoked by performing an `INT` 10H with AH set
to 10H. If AL is 0 (subfunction 0), then BL contains the number of the
palette register to set, and BH contains the value to set that register
to. If AL is 1 (subfunction 1), then BH contains the value to set the
overscan (border) color to. Finally, if AL is 2 (subfunction 2), then
ES:DX points to a 17-byte array containing the values to set palette
registers 0-15 and the overscan register to. (For completeness, although
it's unrelated to the palette registers, there is one more subfunction
of video function 10H. If AL = 3 (subfunction 3), bit 0 of BL is set to
1 to cause bit 7 of text attributes to select blinking, or set to 0 to
cause bit 7 of text attributes to select highreverse video.)

![**Figure 29.3**  *Bit organization within a palette register.*](../images/29-03.jpg)

Listing 29.3 uses video function 10H, subfunction 2 to step through all
64 possible colors. This is accomplished by putting up 16 color bars,
one for each of the 16 possible 4-bit pixel values, then changing the
mapping provided by the palette registers to select a different group of
16 colors from the set of 64 each time a key is pressed. Initially,
colors 0-15 are displayed, then 1-16, then 2-17, and so on up to color
3FH wrapping around to colors 0-14, and finally back to colors 0-15. (By
the way, at mode set time the 16 palette registers are not set to colors
0-15, but rather to 0H, 1H, 2H, H, 4H, 5H, 14H, 7H, 38H, 39H, 3AH, 3BH,
3CH, 3DH, 3EH, and 3FH, respectively. Bits 6, 5, and 4—secondary red,
green, and blue—are all set to 1 in palette registers 8-15 in order to
produce high-intensity colors. Palette register 6 is set to 14H to
produce brown, rather than the yellow that the expected value of 6H
would produce.)

When you run Listing 29.3, you'll see that the whole screen changes
color as each new color set is selected. This occurs because most of the
pixels on the screen have a value of 0, selecting the background color
stored in palette register 0, and we're reprogramming palette register 0
right along with the other 15 palette registers.

It's important to understand that in Listing 29.3 the contents of
display memory are never changed after initialization. The only change
is the mapping from the 4-bit pixel data coming out of display memory to
the 6-bit data going to the monitor. For this reason, it's technically
inaccurate to speak of bits in display memory as representing colors;
more accurately, they represent attributes in the range 0-15, which are
mapped to colors 0-3FH by the palette registers.

### Overscan

While we're at it, I'm going to touch on overscan. Overscan is the color
of the border of the display, the rectangular area around the edge of
the monitor that's outside the region displaying active video data but
inside the blanking area. The overscan (or border) color can be
programmed to any of the 64 possible colors by either setting Attribute
Controller register 11H directly or calling video function 10H,
subfunction 1.

> On ECD-compatible monitors, however, there's too little scan time to
> display a proper border when the EGA is in 350-scan-line mode, so
> overscan should always be 0 (black) unless you're in 200-scanmode. Note,
> though, that a VGA can easily display a border on a VGA-compatible

### A Bonus Blanker

An interesting bonus: The Attribute Controller provides a very
convenient way to blank the screen, in the form of the aforementioned
bit 5 of the Attribute Controller Index register (at address 3C0H after
the Input Status 1 register—3DAH in color, 3BAH in monochrome—has been
read and on every other write to 3C0H thereafter). Whenever bit 5 of the
AC Index register is 0, video data is cut off, effectively blanking the
screen. Setting bit 5 of the AC Index back to 1 restores video data
immediately. Listing 29.4 illustrates this simple but effective form of
screen blanking.

Does that do it for color selection? Yes and no. For the EGA, we've
covered the whole of color selection—but not so for the VGA. The VGA can
emulate everything we've discussed, but actually performs one 4-bit to
8-bit translation (except in 256-color modes, where all 256 colors are
simultaneously available), followed by yet another translation, this one
8-bit to 18-bit. What's more, the VGA has the ability to flip instantly
through as many as 16 16-color sets. The VGA's color selection
capabilities, which are supported by another set of BIOS functions, can
be used to produce stunning color effects, as we'll see when we cover
them starting in Chapter 33.

### Modifying VGA Registers

EGA registers are not readable. VGA registers are readable. This
revelation will not come as news to most of you, but many programmers
still insist on setting entire VGA registers even when they're modifying
only selected bits, as if they were programming the EGA. This comes to
mind because I recently received a query inquiring why write mode 1 (in
which the contents of the latches are copied directly to display memory)
didn't work in Mode X. (I'll go into Mode X in detail later in this
book.) Actually, write mode 1 does work in Mode X; it didn't work when
this particular correspondent enabled it because he did so by writing
the value 01H to the Graphics Mode register. As it happens, the write
mode field is only one of several fields in that register, as shown in
Figure 29.4. In 256-color modes, one of the other fields—bit 6, which
enables 256-color pixel formatting—is not 0, and setting it to 0 messes
up the screen quite thoroughly.

The correct way to set a field within a VGA register is, of course, to
read the register, mask off the desired field, insert the desired
setting, and write the result back to the register. In the case of
setting the VGA to write mode 1, do this:

```nasm
mov   dx,3ceh          ;Graphics controller index
mov   al,5             ;Graphics mode reg index
out   dx,al            ;point GC index to G_MODE
inc   dx               ;Graphics controller data
in    al,dx            ;get current mode setting
and   al,not 3         ;mask off write mode field
or    al,1             ;set write mode field to 1
out   dx,al            ;set write mode 1
```

This approach is more of a nuisance than simply setting the whole
register, but it's safer. It's also slower; for cases where you must set
a field repeatedly, it might be worthwhile to read and mask the register
once at the start, and save it in a variable, so that the value is
readily available in memory and need not be repeatedly read from the
port. This approach is especially attractive because `IN`s are much
slower than memory accesses on 386 and 486 machines.

Astute readers may wonder why I didn't put a delay sequence, such as
`JMP \$+2`, between the `IN` and `OUT` involving the same
register. There are, after all, guidelines from IBM, specifying that a
certain period should be allowed to elapse before a second access to an
I/O port is attempted, because not all devices can respond as rapidly as
a 286 or faster CPU can access a port. My answer is that while I can't
guarantee that a delay isn't needed, I've never found a VGA that
required one; I suspect that the delay specification has more to do with
motherboard chips such as the timer, the interrupt controller, and the
like, and I sure hate to waste the delay time if it's not necessary.
However, I've never been able to find anyone with the definitive word on
whether delays might ever be needed when accessing VGAs, so if you know
the gospel truth, or if you know of a VGA/processor combo that does
require delays, please let me know by contacting me through the
publisher. You'd be doing a favor for a whole generation of graphics
programmers who aren't sure whether they're skating on thin ice without
those legendary delays.
