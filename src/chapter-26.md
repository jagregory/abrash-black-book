## Chapter 26 -- VGA Write Mode 3

### The Write Mode That Grows on You

Over the last three chapters, we've covered the VGA's write path from
stem to stern—with one exception. Thus far, we've only looked at how
writes work in write mode 0, the straightforward, workhorse mode in
which each byte that the CPU writes to display memory fans out across
the four planes. (Actually, we also took a quick look at write mode 1,
in which the latches are always copied unmodified, but since exactly the
same result can be achieved by setting the Bit Mask register to 0 in
write mode 0, write mode 1 is of little real significance.)

Write mode 0 is a very useful mode, but some of VGA's most interesting
capabilities involve the two write modes that we have yet to examine:
write mode 1, and, especially, write mode 3. We'll get to write mode 1
in the next chapter, but right now I want to focus on write mode 3,
which can be confusing at first, but turns out to be quite a bit more
powerful than one might initially think.

### A Mode Born in Strangeness

Write mode 3 is strange indeed, and its use is not immediately obvious.
The first time I encountered write mode 3, I understood immediately how
it functioned, but could think of very few useful applications for it.
As time passed, and as I came to understand the atrocious performance
characteristics of `OUT` instructions, and the importance of text and
pattern drawing as well, write mode 3 grew considerably in my
estimation. In fact, my esteem for this mode ultimately reached the
point where in the last major chunk of 16-color graphics code I wrote,
write mode 3 was used more than write mode 0 overall, excluding simple
pixel copying. So write mode 3 is well worth using, but to use it you
must first understand it. Here's how it works.

In write mode 3, set/reset is automatically enabled for all four planes
(the Enable Set/Reset register is ignored). The CPU data byte is rotated
and then ANDed with the contents of the Bit Mask register, and the
result of this operation is used as the contents of the Bit Mask
register alone would normally be used. (If this is Greek to you, have a
look back at Chapters 23 through 25. There's no way to understand write
mode 3 without understanding the rest of the VGA's write data path
first.)

That's what write mode 3 does—but what is it *for?* It turns out that
write mode 3 is excellent for a surprisingly large number of purposes,
because it makes it possible to avoid the bane of VGA performance,
`OUT`s. Some uses for write mode 3 include lines, circles, and solid
and two-color pattern fills. Most importantly, write mode 3 is ideal for
transparent text; that is, it makes it possible to draw text in 16-color
graphics mode quickly without wiping out the background in the process.
(As we'll see at the end of this chapter, write mode 3 is potentially
terrific for opaque text—text drawn with the character box filled in
with a solid color—as well.)

Listing 26.1 is a modification of code I presented in Chapter 25. That
code used the data rotate and bit mask features of the VGA to draw
bit-mapped text in write mode 0. Listing 26.1 uses write mode 3 in place
of the bit mask to draw bit-mapped text, and in the process gains the
useful ability to preserve the background into which the text is being
drawn. Where the original text-drawing code drew the entire character
box for each character, with 0 bits in the font pattern causing a black
box to appear around each character, the code in Listing 26.1 affects
display memory only when 1 bits in the font pattern are drawn. As a
result, the characters appear to be painted into the background, rather
than over it. Another advantage of the code in Listing 26.1 is that the
characters can be drawn in any of the 16 available colors.

The key to understanding Listing 26.1 is understanding the effect of
ANDing the rotated CPU data with the contents of the Bit Mask register.
The CPU data is the pattern for the character to be drawn, with bits
equal to 1 indicating where character pixels are to appear. The Data
Rotate register is set to rotate the CPU data to pixel-align it, since
without rotation characters could only be drawn on byte boundaries.

> ![](images/i.jpg)
> As I pointed out in Chapter 25, the CPU is perfectly capable of rotating
> the data itself, and it's often the case that that's more efficient. The
> problem with using the Data Rotate register is that the `OUT` that
> sets that register is time-consuming, especially for proportional text,
> which requires a different rotation for each character. Also, if the
> code performs full-byte accesses to display memory—that is, if it
> combines pieces of two adjacent characters into one byte—whenever
> possible for efficiency, the CPU generally has to do extra work to
> prepare the data so the VGA's rotator can handle it.

At the same time that the Data Rotate register is set, the Bit Mask
register is set to allow the CPU to modify only that portion of the
display memory byte accessed that the pixel-aligned character falls in,
so that other characters and/or graphics data won't be wiped out. The
result of ANDing the rotated CPU data byte with the contents of the Bit
Mask register is a bit mask that allows only the bits equal to 1 in the
original character pattern (rotated and masked to provide pixel
alignment) to be modified by the CPU; all other bits come straight from
the latches. The latches should have previously been loaded from the
target address, so the effect of the ultimate synthesized bit mask value
is to allow the CPU to modify only those pixels in display memory that
correspond to the 1 bits in that part of the pixel-aligned character
that falls in the currently addressed byte. The color of the pixels set
by the CPU is determined by the contents of the Set/Reset register.

Whew. It sounds complex, but given an understanding of what the data
rotator, set/reset, and the bit mask do, it's not that bad. One good way
to make sense of it is to refer to the original text-drawing program in
Listing 25.1 back in Chapter 25, and then see how Listing 26.1 differs
from that program.

It's worth noting that the results generated by Listing 26.1 could have
been accomplished without write mode 3. Write mode 0 could have been
used instead, but at a significant performance cost. Instead of letting
write mode 3 rotate the CPU data and AND it with the contents of the Bit
Mask register, the CPU could simply have rotated the CPU data directly
and ANDed it with the value destined for the Bit Mask register and then
set the Bit Mask register to the resulting value. Additionally, enable
set/reset could have been forced on for all planes, emulating what write
mode 3 does to provide pixel colors.

The write mode 3 approach used in Listing 26.1 can be efficiently
extended to drawing large blocks of text. For example, suppose that we
were to draw a line of 8-pixel-wide bit-mapped text 40 characters long.
We could then set up the bit mask and data rotation as appropriate for
the left portion of each bit-aligned character (the portion of each
character to the left of the byte boundary) and then draw the left
portions only of all 40 characters in write mode 3. Then the bit mask
could be set up for the right portion of each character, and the right
portions of all 40 characters could be drawn. The VGA's fast rotator
would be used to do all rotation, and the only `OUT`s required would
be those required to set the bit mask and data rotation. This technique
could well outperform single-character bit-mapped text drivers such as
the one in Listing 26.1 by a significant margin. Listing 26.2
illustrates one implementation of such an approach. Incidentally, note
the use of the 8x14 ROM font in Listing 26.2, rather than the 8x8 ROM
font used in Listing 26.1. There is also an 8x16 font stored in ROM,
along with the tables used to alter the 8x14 and 8x16 ROM fonts into
9x14 and 9x16 fonts.

In this chapter, I've tried to give you a feel for how write mode 3
works and what it might be used for, rather than providing polished,
optimized, plug-it-in-and-go code. Like the rest of the VGA's write
path, write mode 3 is a resource that can be used in a remarkable
variety of ways, and I don't want to lock you into thinking of it as
useful in just one context. Instead, you should take the time to
thoroughly understand what write mode 3 does, and then, when you do VGA
programming, think about how write mode 3 can best be applied to the
task at hand. Because I focused on illustrating the operation of write
mode 3, neither listing in this chapter is the fastest way to accomplish
the desired result. For example, Listing 26.2 could be made nearly twice
as fast by simply having the CPU rotate, mask, and join the bytes from
adjacent characters, then draw the combined bytes to display memory in a
single operation.

Similarly, Listing 26.1 is designed to illustrate write mode 3 and its
interaction with the rest of the VGA as a contrast to Listing 25.1 in
Chapter 25, rather than for maximum speed, and it could be made
considerably more efficient. If we were going for performance, we'd have
the CPU not only rotate the bytes into position, but also do the masking
by ANDing in software. Even more significantly, we would have the CPU
combine adjacent characters into complete, rotated bytes whenever
possible, so that only one drawing operation would be required per byte
of display memory modified. By doing this, we would eliminate all
per-character `OUT`s, and would minimize display memory accesses,
approximately doubling text-drawing speed.

As a final note, consider that non-transparent text could also be
accelerated with write mode 3. The latches could be filled with the
background (text box) color, set/reset could be set to the foreground
(text) color, and write mode 3 could then be used to turn monochrome
text bytes written by the CPU into characters on the screen with just
one write per byte. There are complications, such as drawing partial
bytes, and rotating the bytes to align the characters, which we'll
revisit later on in Chapter 55, while we're working through the details
of the X-Sharp library. Nonetheless, the performance benefit of this
approach can be a speedup of as much as four times—all thanks to the
decidedly quirky but surprisingly powerful and flexible write mode 3.

### A Note on Preserving Register Bits

If you take a quick look, you'll see that the code in Listing 26.1 uses
the readable register feature of the VGA to preserve reserved bits and
bits other than those being modified. Older adapters such as the CGA and
EGA had few readable registers, so it was necessary to set all bits in a
register whenever that register was modified. Happily, all VGA registers
are readable, which makes it possible to change only those bits of
immediate interest, and, in general, I highly recommend doing exactly
that, since IBM (or clone manufacturers) may well someday use some of
those reserved bits or change the meanings of some of the bits that are
currently in use.
