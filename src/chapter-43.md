## Chapter 43 -- Bit-Plane Animation

### A Simple and Extremely Fast Animation Method for Limited Color

When it comes to computers, my first love is animation. There's nothing
quite like the satisfaction of fooling the eye and creating a miniature
reality simply by rearranging a few bytes of display memory. What makes
animation particularly interesting is that it has to happen fast (as
measured in human time), and without blinking and flickering, or else
you risk destroying the illusion of motion and solidity. Those
constraints make animation the toughest graphics challenge—and also the
most rewarding.

It pains me to hear industry pundits rag on the PC when it comes to
animation. Okay, I'll grant you that the PC isn't a Silicon Graphics
workstation and never will be, but then neither is anything else on the
market. The VGA offers good resolution and color, and while the hardware
wasn't *designed* for animation, that doesn't mean we can't put it to
work in that capacity. One lesson that any good PC graphics or assembly
programmer learns quickly is that it's what the PC's hardware *can*
do—not what it was intended to do—that's important. (By the way, if I
were to pick one aspect of the PC to dump on, it would be sound, not
animation. The PC's sound circuity really is lousy, and it's hard to
understand why that should be, given that a cheap sound chip—which even
the almost-forgotten PC*jr*had—would have changed everything. I guess
IBM figured "serious" computer users would be put off by a computer that
could make fun noises.)

Anyway, my point is that the PC's animation capabilities are pretty
good. There's a trick, though: You can only push the VGA to its
animation limits by stretching your mind a bit and using some unorthodox
approaches to animation. In fact, stretching your mind is the key to
producing good code for *any* task on the PC—that's the topic of the
first part of this book. For most software, however, it's not fatal if
your code isn't excellent—there's slow but functional software all over
the place. When it comes to VGA animation, though, you won't get to
first base without a clever approach.

So, what clever approaches do I have in mind? All sorts. The resources
of the VGA (or even its now-ancient predecessor, the EGA) are many and
varied, and can be applied and combined in hundreds of ways to produce
effective animation. For example, refer back to Chapter 23 for an
example of page flipping. Or look at the July 1986 issue of *PC Tech
Journal*, which describes the basic block-move animation technique, or
the August 1987 issue of *PC Tech Journal*, which shows a
software-sprite scheme built around the EGA's vertical interrupt and the
AND-OR image drawing technique. Or look over the rest of this book,
which contains dozens of tips and tricks that can be applied to
animation, including Mode X-based techniques starting in Chapter 47 that
are the basis for many commercial games.

This chapter adds yet another sort of animation to the list. We're going
to take advantage of the bit-plane architecture and color palette of the
VGA to develop an animation architecture that can handle several
overlapping images with terrific speed and with virtually perfect visual
quality. This technique produces no overlap effects or flicker and
allows us to use the fastest possible method to draw images—the `REP
MOVS` instruction. It has its limitations, but unlike Mode X and some
other animation techniques, the techniques I'll show you in this chapter
will also work on the EGA, which may be important in some applications.

As with any technique on the PC, there are tradeoffs involved with
bit-plane animation. While bit-plane animation is extremely attractive
as far as performance and visual quality are concerned, it is somewhat
limited. Bit-plane animation supports only four colors plus the
background color at any one time, each image must consist of only one of
the four colors, and it's preferable that images of the same color not
intersect.

It doesn't much matter if bit-plane animation isn't perfect for all
applications, though. The real point of showing you bit-plane animation
is to bring home the reality that the VGA is a complex adapter with many
resources, and that you can do remarkable things if you understand those
resources and come up with creative ways to put them to work at specific
tasks.

### Bit-Planes: The Basics

The underlying principle of bit-plane animation is extremely simple. The
VGA has four separate bit planes in modes 0DH, 0EH, 10H, and 12H. Plane
0 normally contains data for the blue component of pixel color, plane 1
normally contains green pixel data, plane 2 red pixel data, and plane 3
intensity pixel data—but we're going to mix that up a bit in a moment,
so we'll simply refer to them as planes 0, 1, 2, and 3 from now on.

Each bit plane can be written to independently. The contents of the four
bit planes are used to generate pixels, with the four bits that control
the color of each pixel coming from the four planes. However, the bits
from the planes go through a look-up stage on the way to becoming
pixels—they're used to look up a 6-bit color from one of the sixteen
palette registers. Figure 43.1 shows how the bits from the four planes
feed into the palette registers to select the color of each pixel. (On
the VGA specifically, the output of the palette registers goes to the
DAC for an additional look-up stage, as described in Chapters 33 and 34
and also Chapter A on the companion CD-ROM.)

Take a good look at Figure 43.1. Any light bulbs going on over your head
yet? If not, consider this. The general problem with VGA animation is
that it's complex and time-consuming to manipulate images that span the
four planes (as most do), and that it's hard to avoid interference
problems when images intersect, since those images share the same bits
in display memory. Since the four bit planes can be written to and read
from independently, it should be apparent that if we could come up with
a way to display images from each plane independently of whatever images
are stored in the other planes, we would have four sets of images that
we could manipulate very easily. There would be no interference effects
between images in different planes, because images in one plane wouldn't
share bits with images in another plane. What's more, since all the bits
for a given image would reside in a single plane, we could do away with
the cumbersome programming of the VGA's complex hardware that is needed
to manipulate images that span multiple planes.

![**Figure 43.1**  *How 4 bits of video data become 6 bits of color.*](../images/43-01.jpg)

All in all, it would be a good deal if we could store each image in a
single plane, as shown in Figure 43.2. However, a problem arises when
images in different planes overlap, as shown in Figure 43.3. The
combined bits from overlapping images generate new colors, so the
overlapping parts of the images don't look like they belong to either of
the two images. What we really want, of course, is for one of the images
to appear to be in front of the other. It would be better yet if the
rearward image showed through any transparent (that is,
background-colored) parts of the forward image. Can we do that?

You bet.

![**Figure 43.3**  *The problem of overlapping colors.*](../images/43-03.jpg)

#### Stacking the Palette Registers

Suppose that instead of viewing the four bits per pixel coming out of
display memory as selecting one of sixteen colors,we view those bits as
selecting one of *four* colors. If the bit from plane 0 is 1, that would
select color 0 (say, red). The bit from plane 1 would select color 1
(say, green), the bit from plane 2 would select color 2 (say, blue), and
the bit from plane 3 would select color 3 (say, white). Whenever more
than 1 bit is 1, the 1 bit from the lowest-numbered plane would
determine the color, and 1 bits from all other planes would be ignored.
Finally, the absence of any 1 bits at all would select the background
color (say, black).

That would give us four colors and the background color. It would also
give us nifty image precedence, with images in plane 0 appearing to be
in front of images from the other planes, images in plane 1 appearing to
be in front of images from planes 2 and 3, and so on. It would even give
us transparency, where rearward images would show through holes within
and around the edges of images in forward planes. Finally, and most
importantly, it would meet all the criteria needed to allow us to store
each image in a single plane, letting us manipulate the images very
quickly and with no reprogramming of the VGA's hardware other than the
few `OUT` instructions required to select the plane we want to write
to.

Which leaves only one question: How do we get this magical
pixel-precedence scheme to work? As it turns out, all we need to do is
reprogram the palette registers so that the 1 bit from the plane with
the highest precedence determines the color. The palette RAM settings
for the colors described above are summarized in Table 43.1.

Remember that the 4-bit values coming from display memory select which
palette register provides the actual pixel color. Given that, it's easy
to see that the rightmost 1-bit of the four bits coming from display
memory in Table 43.1 selects the pixel color. If the bit from plane 0 is
1, then the color is red, no matter what the other bits are, as shown in
Figure 43.4. If the bit from plane 0 is 0, then if the bit from plane 1
is 1 the color is green, and so on for planes 2 and 3. In other words,
with the palette register settings we instantly have exactly what we
want, which is an approach that keeps images in one plane from
interfering with images in other planes while providing precedence and
transparency.

Seems almost too easy, doesn't it? Nonetheless, it works beautifully, as
we'll see very shortly. First, though, I'd like to point out that
there's nothing sacred about plane 0 having precedence. We could
rearrange the palette register settings so that any plane had the
highest precedence, followed by the other planes in any order. I've
chosen to make plane 0 the highest precedence only because it seems
simplest to think of plane 0 as appearing in front of plane 1, which is
in front of plane 2, which is in front of plane 3.

### Bit-Plane Animation in Action

Without further ado, Listing 43.1 shows bit-plane animation in action.
Listing 43.1 animates 13 rather large images (each 32 pixels on a side)
over a complex background at a good clip *even on a primordial
8088-based PC*. Five of the images move very quickly, while the other 8
bounce back and forth at a steady pace.

For those of you who haven't experienced the frustrations of animation
programming on a PC, there's a *whole* lot of animation going on in
Listing 43.1. What's more, the animation is virtually flicker-free,
partly thanks to bit-plane animation and partly because images are never
really erased but rather are simply overwritten. (The principle behind
the animation is that of redrawing each image with a blank fringe around
it when it moves, so that the blank fringe erases the part of the old
image that the new image doesn't overwrite. For details on this sort of
animation, see the above-mentioned *PC Tech Journal* July 1986 article.)
Better yet, the red images take precedence over the green images, which
take precedence over the blue images, which take precedence over the
white backdrop, and all obscured images show through holes in and around
the edges of images in front of them.

In short, Listing 43.1 accomplishes everything we wished for earlier in
an animation technique.

If you possibly can, run Listing 43.1. The animation may be a revelation
to those of you who are used to weak, slow animation on PCs with EGA or
VGA adapters. Bit-plane animation makes the PC look an awful lot
like—dare I say it?—a games machine.

Listing 43.1 was designed to run at the absolute fastest speed, and as I
mentioned it puts in a pretty amazing performance on the slowest PCs of
all. Assuming you'll be running Listing 43.1 on an faster computer,
you'll have to crank up the `DELAY` equate at the start of Listing
43.1 to slow things down to a reasonable pace. (It's not a very good
game where all the pieces are a continual blur!) Even on something as
modest as a 286-based AT, Listing 43.1 runs much too fast without a
substantial delay (although it does look rather interesting at warp
speed). We should all have such problems, eh? In fact, we could easily
increase the number of animated images past 20 on that old AT, and well
into the hundreds on a cutting-edge local-bus 486 or Pentium.

I'm not going to discuss Listing 43.1 in detail; the code is very
thoroughly commented and should speak for itself, and most of the
individual components of Listing 43.1—the Map Mask register, mode sets,
word versus byte `OUT` instructions to the VGA—have been covered in
earlier chapters. Do notice, however, that Listing 43.1 sets the palette
exactly as I described earlier. This is accomplished by passing a
pointer to a 17-byte array (1 byte for each of the 16 palette registers,
and 1 byte for the border color) to the BIOS video interrupt (`INT`
10H), function 10H, subfunction 2.

Bit-plane animation does have inherent limitations, which we'll get to
in a second. One limitation that is *not* inherent to bit-plane
animation but simply a shortcoming of Listing 43.1 is somewhat choppy
horizontal motion. In the interests of both clarity and keeping Listing
43.1 to a reasonable length, I decided to byte-align all images
horizontally. This saved the many tables needed to define the 7
non-byte-aligned rotations of the images, as well as the code needed to
support rotation. Unfortunately, it also meant that the smallest
possible horizontal movement was 8 pixels (1 byte of display memory),
which is far enough to be noticeable at certain speeds. The situation
is, however, easily correctable with the additional rotations and code.
We'll see an implementation of fully rotated images (in this case for
Mode X, but the principles generalize nicely) in Chapter 49. Vertically,
where there is no byte-alignment issue, the images move 4 or 6 pixels at
a times, resulting in considerably smoother animation.

The addition of code to support rotated images would also open the door
to support for internal animation, where the appearance of a given image
changes over time to suggest that the image is an active entity. For
example, propellers could whirl, jaws could snap, and jets could flare.
Bit-plane animation with bit-aligned images and internal animation can
look truly spectacular. It's a sight worth seeing, particularly for
those who doubt the PC's worth when it comes to animation.

### Limitations of Bit-Plane Animation

As I've said, bit-plane animation is not perfect. For starters,
bit-plane animation can only be used in the VGA's planar modes, modes
0DH, 0EH, 10H, and 12H. Also, the reprogramming of the palette registers
that provides image precedence also reduces the available color set from
the normal 16 colors to just 5 (one color per plane plus the background
color). Worse still, each image must consist entirely of only one of the
four colors. Mixing colors within an image is not allowed, since the
bits for each image are limited to a single plane and can therefore
select only one color. Finally, all images of the same precedence must
be the same color.

It is possible to work around the color limitations to some extent by
using only one or two planes for bit-plane animation, while reserving
the other planes for multi-color drawing. For example, you could use
plane 3 for bit-plane animation while using planes 0-2 for normal
8-color drawing. The images in plane 3 would then appear to be in front
of the 8-color images. If we wanted the plane 3 images to be yellow, we
could set up the palette registers as shown in Table 43.2.

As you can see, the color yellow is displayed whenever a pixel's bit
from plane 3 is 1. This gives the images from plane 3 precedence, while
leaving us with the 8 normal low-intensity colors for images drawn
across the other 3 planes, as shown in Figure 43.5. Of course, this
approach provides only 1 rather than 3 high-precedence planes, but that
might be a good tradeoff for being able to draw multi-colored images as
a backdrop to the high-precedence images. For the right application,
high-speed flicker-free plane 3 images moving in front of an 8-color
backdrop could be a potent combination indeed.

Another limitation of bit-plane animation is that it's best if images
stored in the same plane never cross each other. Why? Because when
images do cross, the blank fringe

around each image can temporarily erase the overlapped parts of the
other image or images, resulting in momentary flicker. While that's not
fatal, it certainly detracts from the rock-solid animation effect of
bit-plane animation.

Not allowing images in the same plane to overlap is actually less of a
limitation than it seems. Run Listing 43.1 again. Unless you were
looking for it, you'd never notice that images of the same color almost
never overlap—there's plenty of action to distract the eye, and the
trajectories of images of the same color are arranged so that they have
a full range of motion without running into each other. The only
exception is the chain of green images, which occasionally doubles back
on itself when it bounces directly into a corner and reverses direction.
Here, however, the images are moving so quickly that the brief moment
during which one image's fringe blanks a portion of another image is
noticeable only upon close inspection, and not particularly unaesthetic
even then.

When a technique has such tremendous visual and performance advantages
as does bit-plane animation, it behooves you to design your animation
software so that the limitations of the animation technique don't get in
the way. For example, you might design a shooting gallery game with all
the images in a given plane marching along in step in a continuous band.
The images could never overlap, so bit-plane animation would produce
very high image quality.

### Shearing and Page Flipping

As Listing 43.1 runs, you may occasionally see an image shear, with the
top and bottom parts of the image briefly offset. This is a consequence
of drawing an image directly into memory as that memory is being scanned
for video data. Occasionally the CRT controller scans a given area of
display memory for pixel data just as the program is changing that same
memory. If the CRT controller scans memory faster than the CPU can
modify that memory, then the CRT controller can scan out the bytes of
display memory that have been already been changed, pass the point in
the image that the CPU is currently drawing, and start scanning out
bytes that haven't yet been changed. The result: Mismatched upper and
lower portions of the image.

If the CRT controller scans more slowly than the CPU can modify memory
(likely with a 386, a fast VGA, and narrow images), then the CPU can rip
right past the CRT controller, with the same net result of mismatched
top and bottom parts of the image, as the CRT controller scans out first
unchanged bytes and then changed bytes. Basically, shear will
occasionally occur unless the CPU and CRT proceed at exactly the same
rate, which is most unlikely. Shear is more noticeable when there are
fewer but larger images, since it's more apparent when a larger screen
area is sheared, and because it's easier to spot one out of three large
images momentarily shearing than one out of twenty small images.

Image shear isn't terrible—I've written and sold several games in which
images occasionally shear, and I've never heard anyone complain—but
neither is it ideal. One solution is page flipping, in which drawing is
done to a non-displayed page of display memory while another page of
display memory is shown on the screen. (We saw page flipping back in
Chapter 23, we'll see it again in the next chapter, and we'll use it
heavily starting in Chapter 47.) When the drawing is finished, the
newly-drawn part of display memory is made the displayed page, so that
the new screen becomes visible all at once, with no shearing or flicker.
The other page is then drawn to, and when the drawing is complete the
display is switched back to that page.

Page flipping can be used in conjunction with bit-plane animation,
although page flipping does diminish some of the unique advantages of
bit-plane animation. Page flipping produces animation of the highest
visual quality whether bit-plane animation is used or not. There are a
few drawbacks to page flipping, however.

Page flipping requires two display memory buffers, one to draw in and
one to display at any given time. Unfortunately, in mode 12H there just
isn't enough memory for two buffers, so page flipping is not an option
in that mode.

Also, page flipping requires that you keep the contents of both buffers
up to date, which can require a good deal of extra drawing.

Finally, page flipping requires that you wait until you're sure the page
has flipped before you start drawing to the other page. Otherwise, you
could end up modifying a page while it's still being displayed,
defeating the whole purpose of page flipping. Waiting for pages to flip
takes time and can slow overall performance significantly. What's more,
it's sometimes difficult to be sure when the page has flipped, since not
all VGA clones implement the display adapter status bits and page flip
timing identically.

To sum up, bit-plane animation by itself is very fast and looks good. In
conjunction with page flipping, bit-plane animation looks a little
better but is slower, and the overall animation scheme is more difficult
to implement and perhaps a bit less reliable on some computers.

### Beating the Odds in the Jaw-Dropping Contest

Bit-plane animation is neat stuff. Heck, good animation of *any* sort is
fun, and the PC is as good a place as any (well, almost any) to make
people's jaws drop. (Certainly it's the place to go if you want to make
a *lot* of jaws drop.) Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do good
animation on the PC. You can—*if* you stretch your mind to find ways to
bring the full power of the VGA to bear on your applications. Bit-plane
animation isn't for every task; neither are page flipping,
exclusive-ORing, pixel panning, or any of the many other animation
techniques you have available. One or more tricks from that grab-bag
should give you what you need, though, and the bigger your grab-bag, the
better your programs.
