## Chapter 20 -- Pentium Rules

### How Your Carbon-Based Optimizer Can Put the "Super" in Superscalar

At the 1983 West Coast Computer Faire, my friend Dan Illowsky, Andy
Greenberg (co-author of Wizardry, at that time the best-selling computer
game ever), and I had an animated discussion about starting a company in
the then-budding world of microcomputer software. One hot new software
category at the time was educational software, and one of the hottest
new educational software companies was Spinnaker Software. Andy used
Spinnaker as an example of a company that had been aimed at a good
market and started up properly, and was succeeding as a result. Dan
didn't buy this; his point was that Spinnaker had been given a bundle of
money to get off the ground, and was growing only by spending a lot of
that money in order to move its products. "Heck," said Dan, "I could get
that kind of market share too if I gave away a fifty-dollar bill with
each of my games."

Remember, this was a time when a program, two diskette drives (for
duplicating disks), and a couple of ads were enough to start a company,
and, in fact, Dan built a very successful game company out of not much
more than that. (I'll never forget coming to visit one day and finding
his apartment stuffed literally to the walls and ceiling with boxes of
diskettes and game packages; he had left a narrow path to the computer
so his wife and his mother could get in there to duplicate disks.) Back
then, the field was wide open, with just about every competent
programmer thinking of striking out on his or her own to try to make
their fortune, and Dan and Andy and I were no exceptions. In short, we
were having a perfectly normal conversation, and Dan's comment was both
appropriate, and, in retrospect, accurate.

Appropriate, save for one thing: We were having this conversation while
walking through a low-rent section of Market Street in San Francisco at
night. A bum sitting against a nearby building overheard Dan, and rose
up, shouting in a quavering voice loud enough to wake the dead,
"Fifty-dollar bill! Fifty-dollar bill! He's giving away fifty-dollar
bills!" We ignored him; undaunted, he followed us for a good half mile,
stopping every few feet to bellow "fifty-dollar bill!" No one else
seemed to notice, and no one hassled us, but I was mighty happy to get
to the sanctuary of the Fairmont Hotel and slip inside.

The point is, most actions aren't inherently good or bad; it's all a
matter of context. If Dan had uttered the words "fifty-dollar bill" on
the West Coast Faire's show floor, no one would have batted an eye. If
he had said it in a slightly worse part of town than he did, we might
have learned just how fast the three of us could run.

Similarly, there's no such thing as inherently fast code, only fast code
in context. At the moment, the context is the Pentium, and the truth is
that a sizable number of the x86 optimization tricks that you and I have
learned over the past ten years are obsolete on the Pentium. True, the
Pentium contains what amounts to about one-and-a-half 486s, but, as
we'll see shortly, that doesn't mean that optimized Pentium code looks
much like optimized 486 code, or that fast 486 code runs particularly
well on a Pentium. (Fast Pentium code, on the other hand, does tend to
run well on the 486; the only major downsides are that it's larger, and
that the `FXCH` instruction, which is largely free on the Pentium, is
expensive on the 486.) So discard your x86 preconceptions as we delve
into superscalar optimization for this one-of-a-kind processor.

### An Instruction in Every Pipe

In the last chapter, we took a quick tour of the Pentium's architecture,
and started to look into the Pentium's optimization rules. Now we're
ready to get to the key rules, those having to do with the Pentium's
most unique and powerful feature, the ability to execute more than one
instruction per cycle. This is known as *superscalar execution*, and has
heretofore been the sole province of fast RISC CPUs. The Pentium has two
integer execution units, called the *U-pipe* and the *V-pipe*, which can
execute two separate instructions simultaneously, potentially doubling
performance—but only under the proper conditions. (There is also a
separate floating-point execution unit that I won't have the space to
cover in this book.) Your job, as a performance programmer, is to
understand the conditions needed for superscalar performance and make
sure they're met, and that's what this and the next chapters are all
about.

The two pipes are not independent processors housed in a single chip;
that is, the Pentium is not like having two 486s in a single computer.
Rather, the two pipes are integral, parallel parts of the same
processor. They operate on the same instruction stream, with the V-pipe
simply executing the next instruction that the U-pipe would have
handled, as shown in Figure 20.1. What the Pentium does, pure and
simple, is execute a single instruction stream and, whenever possible,
take the next two waiting instructions and execute both at once, rather
than one after the other.

The U-pipe is the more capable of the two pipes, able to execute any
instruction in the Pentium's instruction set. (A number of instructions
actually use both pipes at once. Logically, though, you can think of
such instructions as U-pipe instructions, and of the Pentium
optimization model as one in which the U-pipe is able to execute all
instructions and is always active, with the objective being to keep the
V-pipe also working as much of the time as possible.) The U-pipe is
generally similar to a full 486 in terms of both capabilities and
instruction cycle counts. The V-pipe is a 486 subset, able to execute
simple instructions such as `MOV` and `ADD`, but unable to handle
`MUL, DIV`, string instructions, any sort of rotation or shift, or
even `ADC` or `SBB`.

![**Figure 20.1**  *The Pentium's two pipes.*](../images/20-01.jpg)

Getting two instructions executing simultaneously in the two pipes is
trickier than it sounds, not only because the V-pipe can handle only a
relatively small subset of the Pentium's instruction set, but also
because those instructions that the V-pipe can handle are able to pair
only with certain U-pipe instructions. For example, `MOVSD` uses both
pipes, so no instruction can be executed in parallel with `MOVSD`.

Trickier yet, register contention can shut down the V-pipe on any given
cycle, and Address Generation Interlocks (AGIs) can stall either pipe at
any time, as we'll see in the next chapter.

The key to Pentium optimization is to view execution as a stream of
instructions going through the U- and V-pipes, and to eliminate, as much
as possible, instruction mixes that take the V-pipe out of action. In
practice, this is not too difficult. The only hard part is keeping in
mind the long list of rules governing instruction pairing. The place to
begin is with the set of instructions that can go through the V-pipe.

### V-Pipe-Capable Instructions

Any instruction can go through the U-pipe, and, for practical purposes,
the U-pipe is always executing instructions. (The exceptions are when
the U-pipe execution unit is waiting for instruction or data bytes after
a cache miss, and when a U-pipe instruction finishes before a paired
V-pipe instruction, as I'll discuss below.) Only the instructions shown
in Table 20.1 can go through the V-pipe. In addition, the V-pipe can
execute a separate instruction only when one of the instructions listed
in Table 20.2 is executing in the U-pipe; superscalar execution is not
possible while any instruction not listed in Table 20.2 is executing in
the U-pipe. So, for example, if you use `SHR EDX,CL`, which takes 4
cycles to execute, no other instructions can execute during those 4
cycles; if, on the other hand, you use `SHR EDX,10`, it will take 1
cycle to execute in the U-pipe, and another instruction can potentially
execute concurrently in the V-pipe. (As you can see, similar instruction
sequences can have vastly different performance characteristics on the
Pentium.)

Basically, after the current instruction or pair of instructions is
finished (that is, once neither the U- nor V-pipe is executing
anything), the Pentium sends the next instruction through the U-pipe. If
the instruction after the one in the U-pipe is an instruction the V-pipe
can handle, if the instruction in the U-pipe is pairable, and if
register contention doesn't occur, then the V-pipe starts executing that
instruction, as shown in Figure 20.2. Otherwise, the second instruction
waits until the first instruction is done, then executes in the U-pipe,
possibly pairing with the next instruction in line if all pairing
conditions are met.

                    3 cycles otherwise)
```

**Table 20.1 Instructions that can execute in the V-pipe.**

The list of instructions the V-pipe can handle is not very long, and the
list of U-pipe pairable instructions is not much longer, but these
actually constitute the bulk of the instructions used in PC software. As
a result, a fair amount of pairing happens even in normal,
non-Pentium-optimized code. This fact, plus the 64-bit 66 MHz bus,
branch prediction, dual 8K internal caches, and other Pentium features,
together mean that a Pentium is considerably faster than a 486 at the
same clock speed, even without Pentium-specific optimization, contrary
to some reports.

Besides, almost all operations can be performed by combinations of
pairable instructions. For example, `PUSH [*mem*]` is not on either
list, but both `MOV *reg*,[*mem*]` and `PUSH *reg*` are, and those
two instructions can be used to push a value stored in memory. In fact,
given the proper instruction stream, the discrete instructions can
perform this operation effectively in just 1 cycle (taking one-half of
each of 2 cycles, for 2\*0.5 = 1 cycle total execution time), as shown
in Figure 20.3—a full cycle *faster* than `PUSH [*mem*]`, which takes
2 cycles.

![**Figure 20.2**  *Instruction flow through the two pipes.*](../images/20-02.jpg)

One downside of this "RISCification" (turning complex instructions into
simple, RISC-like ones) of Pentium-optimized code is that it makes for
substantially larger code. For example,

```nasm
push dword ptr [esi]
```

is one byte smaller than this sequence:

```nasm
mov eax,[esi]
push eax
```

![**Figure 20.3**  *Pushing a value from memory effectively in one
cycle.*](../images/20-03.jpg)

A more telling example is the following

```nasm
add [MemVar],eax
```

versus the equivalent:

```nasm
mov  edx,[MemVar]
add  edx,eax
mov  [MemVar],edx
```

The single complex instruction takes 3 cycles and is 6 bytes long; with
proper sequencing, interleaving the simple instructions with other
instructions that don't use EDX or `Mem Var`, the three-instruction
sequence can be reduced to 1.5 cycles, but it is *14* bytes long.

### Lockstep Execution

You may wonder why anyone would bother breaking `ADD [MemVar],EAX`
into three instructions, given that this instruction can go through
either pipe with equal ease. The answer is that while the
memory-accessing instructions other than `MOV, PUSH`, and `POP`
listed in Table 20.1 (that is, `INC/DEC [*mem*],
ADD/SUB/XOR/AND/OR/CMP/ADC/SBB *reg*,[*mem*]`, and
`ADD/SUB/XOR/AND/OR/CMP/ADC/SBB [*mem*],*reg/immed*`) can be paired,
they do not provide the 100 percent overlap that we seek. If you look at
Tables 20.1 and 20.2, you will see that instructions taking from 1 to 3
cycles can pair. However, any pair of instructions goes through the two
pipes in lockstep. This means, for example, that if `ADD [EBX],EDX` is
going through the U-pipe, and `INC EAX` is going through the V-pipe,
the V-pipe will be idle for 2 of the 3 cycles that the U-pipe takes to
execute its instruction, as shown in Figure 20.4. Out of the theoretical
6 cycles of work that can be done during this time, we actually get only
4 cycles of work, or 67 percent utilization. Even though these
instructions pair, then, this sequence fails to make maximum use of the
Pentium's horsepower.

The key here is that when two instructions pair, both execution units
are tied up until both instructions have finished (which means at least
for the amount of time required for the longer of the two to execute,
plus possibly some extra cycles for pairable instructions that can't
fully overlap, as described below). The logical conclusion would seem to
be that we should strive to pair instructions of the same lengths, but
that is often not correct.

> ![](../images/i.jpg)

![**Figure 20.4**  *Lockstep execution and idle time in the V-pipe.*](../images/20-04.jpg)

Here's why. The Pentium is fully capable of handling instructions that
use memory operands in either pipe, or, if necessary, in both pipes at
once. Each pipe has its own write FIFO, which buffers the last few
writes and takes care of writing the data out while the Pentium
continues processing. The Pentium also has a write-back internal data
cache, so data that is frequently changed doesn't have to be written to
external memory (which is much slower than the cache) very often. This
combination means that unless you write large blocks of data at a high
speed, the Pentium should be able to keep up with both pipes' memory
writes without stalling execution.

The Pentium is also designed to satisfy both pipes' needs for reading
memory operands with little waiting. The data cache is constructed so
that both pipes can read from the cache *on the same cycle*. This feat
is accomplished by organizing the data cache as eight-banked memory, as
shown in Figure 20.5, with each 32-byte cache line consisting of 8
dwords, 1 in each bank. The banks are independent of one another, so as
long as the desired data is in the cache and the U- and V-pipes don't
try to read from the same bank on the same cycle, both pipes can read
memory operands on the same cycle. (If there is a cache bank collision,
the V-pipe instruction stalls for one cycle.)

Normally, you won't pay close attention to which of the eight dword
banks your paired memory accesses fall in—that's just too much work—but
you might want to watch out for simultaneously read addresses that have
the same values for address

![**Figure 20.5**  *The Pentium's eight bank data cache.*](../images/20-05.jpg)

bits 2, 3, and 4 (fall in the same bank) in tight loops, and you should
also avoid sequences like

```nasm
mov  bl,[esi]
mov  bh,[esi+1]
```

because both operands will generally be in the same bank. An alternative
is to place another instruction between the two instructions that access
the same bank, as in this sequence:

```nasm
mov  bl,[esi]
mov  edi,edx
mov  bh,[esi+1]
```

By the way, the reason a code sequence that takes two instructions to
load a single word is attractive in a 32-bit segment is because it takes
only one cycle when the two instructions can be paired with other
instructions; by contrast, the obvious way of loading BX

```nasm
mov bx,[esi]
```

takes 1.5 to two cycles because the size prefix can't pair, as described
below. This is yet another example of how different Pentium optimization
can be from everything we've learned about its predecessors.

The problem with pairing non-single-cycle instructions arises when a
pipe executes an instruction other than `MOV` that has an explicit
memory operand. (I'll call these *complex memory instructions*. They're
the only pairable instructions, other than branches, that take more than
one cycle.) We've already seen that, because instructions go through the
pipes in lockstep, if one pipe executes a complex memory instruction
such as `ADD EAX,[EBX]` while the other pipe executes a single-cycle
instruction, the pipe with the faster instruction will sit idle for part
of the time, wasting cycles. You might think that if both pipes execute
complex instructions of the same length, then neither would lie idle,
but that turns out to not always be the case. Two two-cycle instructions
(instructions with register destination operands) can indeed pair and
execute in two cycles, so it's okay to pair two instructions such as
these:

```nasm
add esi,[SourceSkip]        ;U-pipe cycles 1 and 2
add edi,[DestinationSkip]   ;V-pipe cycles 1 and 2
```

However, this beneficial pairing does not extend to non-`MOV`
instructions with explicit memory destination operands, such as **ADD
[EBX],EAX**. The Pentium executes only one such memory instruction at a
time; if two memory-destination complex instructions get paired, first
the U-pipe instruction is executed, and then the V-pipe instruction,
with only one cycle of overlap, as shown in Figure 20.6. I don't know
for sure, but I'd guess that this is to guarantee that the two pipes
will never perform out-of-order access to any given memory location.
Thus, even though `AND [EBX],AL` pairs with `AND [ECX],DL`, the two
instructions take 5 cycles in all to execute, and 4 cycles of idle
time—2 in the U-pipe and 2 in the V-pipe, out of 10 cycles in all—are
incurred in the process.

![**Figure 20.6**  *Non-overlapped lockstep execution.*](../images/20-06.jpg)

![**Figure 20.7**  *Interleaving simple instructions for maximum
performance.*](../images/20-07.jpg)

The solution is to break the instructions into simple instructions and
interleave them, as shown in Figure 20.7, which accomplishes the same
task in 3 cycles, with no idle cycles whatsoever. Figure 20.7 is a good
example of what optimized Pentium code generally looks like: mostly
one-cycle instructions, mixed together so that at least two operations
are in progress at once. It's not the easiest code to read or write, but
it's the only way to get both pipes running at capacity.

### Superscalar Notes

You may well ask why it's necessary to interleave operations, as is done
in Figure 20.7. It seems simpler just to turn

```nasm
and [ebx],al
```

into

```nasm
mov   dl,[ebx]
and   dl,al
mov   [ebx],dl
```

and be done with it. The problem here is one of dependency. Before the
Pentium can execute `AND DL,AL,`, it must first know what is in DL,
and it can't know that until it loads DL from the address pointed to by
EBX. Therefore, `AND DL,AL` can't happen until the cycle after `MOV
DL,[EBX]` executes. Likewise, the result can't be stored until the
cycle after `AND DL,AL` has finished. This means that these
instructions, as written, can't possibly pair, so the sequence takes the
same three cycles as `AND [EBX],AL`. (Now it should be clear why `AND
[EBX]`, AL takes 3 cycles.) Consequently, it's necessary to interleave
these instructions with instructions that use other registers, so this
set of operations can execute in one pipe while the other, unrelated set
executes in the other pipe, as is done in Figure 20.7.

What we've just seen is the read-after-write form of the superscalar
hazard known as *register contention*. I'll return to the subject of
register contention in the next chapter; in the remainder of this
chapter I'd like to cover a few short items about superscalar execution.

#### Register Starvation

The above examples should make it pretty clear that effective
superscalar programming puts a lot of strain on the Pentium's relatively
small register set. There are only seven general-purpose registers (I
strongly suggest using EBP in critical loops), and it does not help to
have to sacrifice one of those registers for temporary storage on each
complex memory operation; in pre-superscalar days, we used to employ
those handy CISC memory instructions to do all that stuff without using
any extra registers.

Also be aware that prefixes of every sort, with the sole exception of
the 0FH prefix on non-short conditional jumps, always execute in the
U-pipe, and that Intel's documentation indicates that no pairing can
happen while a prefix byte executes. (As I'll discuss in the next
chapter, my experiments indicate that this rule doesn't always apply to
multiple-cycle instructions, but you still won't go far wrong by
assuming that the above rule is correct and trying to eliminate prefix
bytes.) A prefix byte takes one cycle to execute; after that cycle, the
actual prefixed instruction itself will go through the U-pipe, and if it
and the following instruction are mutually pairable, then they will
pair. Nonetheless, prefix bytes are very expensive, effectively taking
at least as long as two normal instructions, and possibly, if a prefixed
instruction could otherwise have paired in the V-pipe with the previous
instruction, taking as long as three normal instructions, as shown in
Figure 20.8.

Finally, bear in mind that if the instructions being executed have not
already been executed at least once since they were loaded into the
internal cache, they can pair only if the first (U-pipe) instruction is
not only pairable but also exactly 1 byte long, a category that includes
only `INC *reg*, DEC *reg*, PUSH *reg*`, and `POP *reg*`. Knowing
this can help you understand why sometimes, timing reveals that your
code runs slower than it seems it should, although this will generally
occur only when the cache working set for the code you're timing is on
the order of 8K or more—an awful lot of code to try to optimize.

It should be excruciatingly clear by this point that you *must* time
your Pentium-optimized code if you're to have any hope of knowing if
your optimizations are working as well as you think they are; there are
just too many details involved for you to be sure your optimizations are
working properly without checking. My most basic optimization rule has
always been to grab the Zen timer and *measure actual performance*—and
nowhere is this more true than on the Pentium. Don't believe it until
you measure it!
