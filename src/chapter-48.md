## Chapter 48 -- Mode X Marks the Latch

### The Internals of Animation's Best Video Display Mode

In the previous chapter, I introduced you to what I call Mode X, an
undocumented 320x240 256-color mode of the VGA. Mode X is distinguished
from mode 13H, the documented 320x200 256-color VGA mode, in that it
supports page flipping, makes off-screen memory available, has square
pixels, and, above all, lets you use the VGA's hardware to increase
performance by as much as four times. (Of course, those four times come
at the cost of more complex and demanding programming, to be sure—but
end users care about results, not how hard the code was to write, and
Mode X delivers results in a big way.) In the previous chapter we saw
how the VGA's plane-oriented hardware can be used to speed solid fills.
That's a nice technique, but now we're going to move up to the big
guns—the VGA latches.

The VGA has four latches, one for each plane of display memory. Each
latch stores exactly one byte, and that byte is always the last byte
read from the corresponding plane of display memory, as shown in Figure
48.1. Furthermore, whenever a given address in display memory is read,
all four planes' bytes at that address are read and stored in the
corresponding latches, regardless of which plane supplied the byte
returned to the CPU (as determined by the Read Map register). As with so
much else about the VGA, the above will make little sense to VGA
neophytes, but the important point is this: By reading one display
memory byte, 4 bytes—one from each plane—can be loaded into the latches
at once. Any or all of those 4 bytes can then be written anywhere in
display memory with a single byte-sized write, as shown in Figure 48.2.

![**Figure 48.1**  *How the VGA latches are loaded.*](../images/48-01.jpg)

![**Figure 48.2**  *Writing 4 bytes to display memory in a single
operation.*](../images/48-02.jpg)

The upshot is that the latches make it possible to copy data around from
one part of display memory to another, 32 bits (four pixels) at a
time—four times as fast as normal. (Recall from the previous chapter
that in Mode X, pixels are stored one per byte, with four pixels in a
row stored in successive planes at the same address, one pixel per
plane.) However, any one latch can only be loaded from and written to
the corresponding plane, so an individual latch can only work with every
fourth pixel on the screen; the latch for plane 0 can work with pixels
0, 4, 8..., the latch for plane 1 with pixels 1, 5, 9..., and so on.

The latches aren't intended for use in 256-color mode—they were designed
to allow individual bits of display memory to be modified in 16-color
mode—but they are nonetheless very useful in Mode X, particularly for
patterned fills and screen-to-screen copies, including scrolls.
Patterned filling is a good place to start, because patterns are widely
used in windowing environments for desktops, window backgrounds, and
scroll bars, and for textures and color dithering in drawing and game
software.

Fast Mode X fills using patterns that are four pixels in width can be
performed by drawing the pattern once to the four pixels at any one
address in display memory, reading that address to load the pattern into
the latches, setting the Bit Mask register to 0 to specify that all bits
drawn to display memory should come from the latches, and then
performing the fill pretty much as we did in the previous chapter—except
that each line of the pattern must be loaded into the latches before the
corresponding scan line on the screen is filled. Listings 48.1 and 48.2
together demonstrate a variety of fast Mode X four-by-four pattern
fills. (The mode set function called by Listing 48.1 is from the
previous chapter's listings.)

Four-pixel-wide patterns are more useful than you might imagine. There
are actually 2128 possible patterns (16 pixels, each with 28 possible
colors); that set is certainly large enough for most color-dithering
purposes, and includes many often-used patterns, such as halftones,
diagonal stripes, and crosshatches.

Furthermore, eight-wide patterns, which are widely used, can be drawn
with two passes, one for each half of the pattern. This principle can in
fact be extended to patterns of arbitrary multiple-of-four widths.
(Widths that aren't multiples of four are considerably more difficult to
handle, because the latches are four pixels wide; one possible solution
is expanding such patterns via repetition until they are
multiple-of-four widths.)

### Allocating Memory in Mode X

Listing 48.2 raises some interesting questions about the allocation of
display memory in Mode X. In Listing 48.2, whenever a pattern is to be
drawn, that pattern is first drawn in its entirety at the very end of
display memory; the latches are then loaded from that copy of the
pattern before each scan line of the actual fill is drawn. Why this
double copying process, and why is the pattern stored in that particular
area of display memory?

The double copying process is used because it's the easiest way to load
the latches. Remember, there's no way to get information directly from
the CPU to the latches; the information must first be written to some
location in display memory, because the latches can be loaded *only*
from display memory. By writing the pattern to off-screen memory, we
don't have to worry about interfering with whatever is currently
displayed on the screen.

As for why the pattern is stored exactly where it is, that's part of a
master memory allocation plan that will come to fruition in the next
chapter, when I implement a Mode X animation program. Figure 48.3 shows
this master plan; the first two pages of memory (each 76,800 pixels
long, spanning 19,200 addresses—that is, 19,200 pixel quadruplets—in
display memory) are reserved for page flipping, the next page of memory
(also 76,800 pixels long) is reserved for storing the background (which
is used to restore the holes left after images move), the last 16 pixels
(four addresses) of display memory are reserved for the pattern buffer,
and the remaining 31,728 pixels (7,932 addresses) of display memory are
free for storage of icons, images, temporary buffers, or whatever.

![**Figure 48.3**  *A useful Mode X display memory layout.*](../images/48-03.jpg)

This is an efficient organization for animation, but there are certainly
many other possible setups. For example, you might choose to have a
solid-colored background, in which case you could dispense with the
background page (instead using the solid rectangle fill routine to
replace the background after images move), freeing up another 76,800
pixels of off-screen storage for images and buffers. You could even
eliminate page-flipping altogether if you needed to free up a great deal
of display memory. For example, with enough free display memory it is
possible in Mode X to create a virtual bitmap three times larger than
the screen, with the screen becoming a scrolling window onto that larger
bitmap. This technique has been used to good effect in a number of
animated games, with and without the use of Mode X.

### Copying Pixel Blocks within Display Memory

Another fine use for the latches is copying pixels from one place in
display memory to another. Whenever both the source and the destination
share the same nibble alignment (that is, their start addresses modulo
four are the same), it is not only possible but quite easy to use the
latches to copy four pixels at a time. Listing 48.3 shows a routine that
copies via the latches. (When the source and destination do not share
the same nibble alignment, the latches cannot be used because the source
and destination planes for any given pixel differ. In that case, you can
set the Read Map register to select a source plane and the Map Mask
register to select the corresponding destination plane. Then, copy all
pixels in that plane, repeating for all four planes.)

Listing 48.3 has an important limitation: It does not guarantee proper
handling when the source and destination overlap, as in the case of a
downward scroll, for example. Listing 48.3 performs top-to-bottom,
left-to-right copying. Downward scrolls require bottom-to-top copying;
likewise, rightward horizontal scrolls require right-to-left copying. As
it happens, my intended use for Listing 48.3 is to copy images between
off-screen memory and on-screen memory, and to save areas under pop-up
menus and the like, so I don't really need overlap handling—and I do
really need to keep the complexity of this discussion down. However, you
will surely want to add overlap handling if you plan to perform
arbitrary scrolling and copying in display memory.

Now that we have a fast way to copy images around in display memory, we
can draw icons and other images as much as four times faster than in
mode 13H, depending on the speed of the VGA's display memory. (In case
you're worried about the nibble-alignment limitation on fast copies,
don't be; I'll address that fully in due time, but the secret is to
store all four possible rotations in off-screen memory, then select the
correct one for each copy.) However, before our fast display
memory-to-display memory copy routine can do us any good, we must have a
way to get pixel patterns from system memory into display memory, so
that they can then be copied with the fast copy routine.

#### Copying to Display Memory

The final piece of the puzzle is the system memory to
display-memory-copy-routine shown in Listing 48.4. This routine assumes
that pixels are stored in system memory in exactly the order in which
they will ultimately appear on the screen; that is, in the same linear
order that mode 13H uses. It would be more efficient to store all the
pixels for one plane first, then all the pixels for the next plane, and
so on for all four planes, because many `OUT`s could be avoided, but
that would make images rather hard to create. And, while it is true that
the speed of drawing images is, in general, often a critical performance
factor, the speed of copying images from system memory to display memory
is not particularly critical in Mode X. Important images can be stored
in off-screen memory and copied to the screen via the latches much
faster than even the speediest system memory-to-display memory copy
routine could manage.

I'm not going to present a routine to perform Mode X copies from display
memory to system memory, but such a routine would be a straightforward
inverse of Listing 48.4.

### Who Was that Masked Image Copier?

At this point, it's getting to be time for us to take all the Mode X
tools we've developed, together with one more tool—masked image
copying—and the remaining unexplored feature of Mode X, page flipping,
and build an animation application. I hope that when we're done, you'll
agree with me that Mode X is *the* way to animate on the PC.

In truth, though, it matters less whether or not *you* think that Mode X
is the best way to animate than whether or not your users think it's the
best way based on results; end users care only about results, not how
you produced them. For my writing, you folks are the end users—and
notice how remarkably little you care about how this book gets written
and produced. You care that it turned up in the bookstore, and you care
about the contents, but you sure as heck don't care about how it got
that far from a bin of tree pulp. When you're a creator, the process
matters. When you're a buyer, results are everything. All important.
*Sine qua non.* The whole enchilada.

If you catch my drift.
