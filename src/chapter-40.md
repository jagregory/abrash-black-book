## Chapter 40 -- Of Songs, Taxes, and the Simplicity of Complex Polygons

### Dealing with Irregular Polygonal Areas

Every so often, my daughter asks me to sing her to sleep. (If you've
ever heard me sing, this may cause you concern about either her hearing
or her judgement, but love knows no bounds.) As any parent is well
aware, singing a young child to sleep can easily take several hours, or
until sunrise, whichever comes last. One night, running low on
children's songs, I switched to a Beatles medley, and at long last her
breathing became slow and regular. At the end, I softly sang "A Hard
Day's Night," then quietly stood up to leave. As I tiptoed out, she
said, in a voice not even faintly tinged with sleep, "Dad, what do they
mean, ‘working like a dog'? Chasing a stick? That doesn't make sense;
people don't chase sticks."

That led us into a discussion of idioms, which made about as much sense
to her as an explanation of quantum mechanics. Finally, I fell back on
my standard explanation of the Universe, which is that a lot of the time
it simply doesn't make sense.

As a general principle, that explanation holds up remarkably well. (In
fact, having just done my taxes, I think Earth is actually run by
blob-creatures from the planet Mrxx, who are helplessly doubled over
with laughter at the ridiculous things they can make us do. "Let's make
them get Social Security numbers for their pets next year!" they're
saying right now, gasping for breath.) Occasionally, however, one has
the rare pleasure of finding a corner of the Universe that makes sense,
where everything fits together as if preordained.

Filling arbitrary polygons is such a case.

### Filling Arbitrary Polygons

In Chapter 38, I described three types of polygons: convex, nonconvex,
and complex. *The RenderMan Companion*, a terrific book by Steve Upstill
(Addison-Wesley, 1990) has an intuitive definition of *convex*: If a
rubber band stretched around a polygon touches all vertices in the order
they're defined, then the polygon is convex. If a polygon has
intersecting edges, it's complex. If a polygon doesn't have intersecting
edges but isn't convex, it's nonconvex. Nonconvex is a special case of
complex, and convex is a special case of nonconvex. (Which, I'm well
aware, makes nonconvex a lousy name—noncomplex would have been
better—but I'm following X Window System nomenclature here.)

The reason for distinguishing between these three types of polygons is
that the more specialized types can be filled with markedly faster
approaches. Complex polygons require the slowest approach; however, that
approach will serve to fill any polygon of any sort. Nonconvex polygons
require less sorting, because edges never cross. Convex polygons can be
filled fastest of all by simply scanning the two sides of the polygon,
as we saw in Chapter 39.

Before we dive into complex polygon filling, I'd like to point out that
the code in this chapter, like all polygon filling code I've ever seen,
requires that the caller describe the type of the polygon to be filled.
Often, however, the caller doesn't know what type of polygon it's
passing, or specifies complex for simplicity, because that will work for
all polygons; in such a case, the polygon filler will use the slow
complex-fill code even if the polygon is, in fact, a convex polygon. In
Chapter 41, I'll discuss one way to improve this situation.

#### Active Edges

The basic premise of filling a complex polygon is that for a given scan
line, we determine all intersections between the polygon's edges and
that scan line and then fill the spans between the intersections, as
shown in Figure 40.1. (Section 3.6 of Foley and van Dam's *Computer
Graphics*, Second Edition provides an overview of this and other aspects
of polygon filling.) There are several rules that might be used to
determine which spans are drawn and which aren't; we'll use the odd/even
rule, which specifies that drawing turns on after odd-numbered
intersections (first, third, and so on) and off after even-numbered
intersections.

The question then becomes how can we most efficiently determine which
edges cross each scan line and where? As it happens, there is a great
deal of coherence from one scan line to the next in a polygon edge list,
because each edge starts at a given Y coordinate and continues unbroken
until it ends. In other words, edges don't leap about and stop and start
randomly; the X coordinate of an edge at one scan line is a consistent
delta from that edge's X coordinate at the last scan line, and that is
consistent for the length of the line.

![**Figure 40.1**  *Filling one scan line by finding intersecting edges.*](../images/40-01.jpg)

This allows us to reduce the number of edges that must be checked for
intersection; on any given scan line, we only need to check for
intersections with the currently active edges—edges that start on that
scan line, plus all edges that start on earlier (above) scan lines and
haven't ended yet—as shown in Figure 40.2. This suggests that we can
proceed from the top scan line of the polygon to the bottom, keeping a
running list of currently active edges—called the *active edge table*
(AET)—with the edges sorted in order of ascending X coordinate of
intersection with the current scan line. Then, we can simply fill each
scan line in turn according to the list of active edges at that line.

![**Figure 40.2**  *Checking currently active edges (solid lines).*](../images/40-02.jpg)

Maintaining the AET from one scan line to the next involves three steps:
First, we must add to the AET any edges that start on the current scan
line, making sure to keep the AET X-sorted for efficient odd/even
scanning. Second, we must remove edges that end on the current scan
line. Third, we must advance the X coordinates of active edges with the
same sort of error term-based, Bresenham's-like approach we used for
convex polygons, again ensuring that the AET is X-sorted after advancing
the edges.

Advancing the X coordinates is easy. For each edge, we'll store the
current X coordinate and all required error term information, and we'll
use that to advance the edge one scan line at a time; then, we'll resort
the AET by X coordinate as needed. Removing edges as they end is also
easy; we'll just count down the length of each active edge on each scan
line and remove an edge when its count reaches zero. Adding edges as
their tops are encountered is a tad more complex. While there are a
number of ways to do this, one particularly efficient approach is to
start out by putting all the edges of the polygon, sorted by increasing
Y coordinate, into a single list, called the *global edge table* (GET).
Then, as each scan line is encountered, all edges at the start of the
GET that begin on the current scan line are moved to the AET; because
the GET is Y-sorted, there's no need to search the entire GET. For still
greater efficiency, edges in the GET that share common Y coordinates can
be sorted by increasing X coordinate; this ensures that no more than one
pass through the AET per scan line is ever needed when adding new edges
from the GET in such a way as to keep the AET sorted in ascending X
order.

What form should the GET and AET take? Linked lists of edge structures,
as shown in Figure 40.3. With linked lists, all that's required to move
edges from the GET to the AET as they become active, sort the AET, and
remove edges that have been fully drawn is the exchanging of a few
pointers.

In summary, we'll initially store all the polygon edges in
Y-primary/X-secondary sort order in the GET, complete with initial X and
Y coordinates, error terms and error term adjustments, lengths, and
directions of X movement for each edge. Once the GET is built, we'll do
the following:

  1. Set the current Y coordinate to the Y coordinate of the first
     edge in the GET.

  2. Move all edges with the current Y coordinate from the GET to the
     AET, removing them from the GET and maintaining the X-sorted order of
     the AET.

  3. Draw all odd-to-even spans in the AET at the current Y
     coordinate.

  4. Count down the lengths of all edges in the AET, removing any
     edges that are done, and advancing the X coordinates of all remaining
     edges in the AET by one scan line.

  5. Sort the AET in order of ascending X coordinate.

  6. Advance the current Y coordinate by one scan line.
  
  7. If either the AET or GET isn't empty, go to step 2.

![**Figure 40.3**  *The global and active edge tables as linked lists.*](../images/40-03.jpg)

That's really all there is to it. Compare Listing 40.1 to the fast
convex polygon filling code from Chapter 39, and you'll see that,
contrary to expectation, complex polygon filling is indeed one of the
more sane and sensible corners of the universe.

**LISTING 40.1 L40-1.C**

```c
/* Color-fills an arbitrarily-shaped polygon described by VertexList.
   If the first and last points in VertexList are not the same, the path
   around the polygon is automatically closed. All vertices are offset
   by (XOffset, YOffset). Returns 1 for success, 0 if memory allocation
   failed. All C code tested with Borland C++.
   If the polygon shape is known in advance, speedier processing may be
   enabled by specifying the shape as follows: "convex" - a rubber band
   stretched around the polygon would touch every vertex in order;
   "nonconvex" - the polygon is not self-intersecting, but need not be
   convex; "complex" - the polygon may be self-intersecting, or, indeed,
   any sort of polygon at all. Complex will work for all polygons; convex
   is fastest. Undefined results will occur if convex is specified for a
   nonconvex or complex polygon.
   Define CONVEX_CODE_LINKED if the fast convex polygon filling code from
   Chapter 38 is linked in. Otherwise, convex polygons are
   handled by the complex polygon filling code.
   Nonconvex is handled as complex in this implementation. See text for a
   discussion of faster nonconvex handling. */

### Complex Polygon Filling: An Implementation

Listing 40.1 just shown presents a function, `FillPolygon()`, that
fills polygons of all shapes. If `CONVEX_FILL_LINKED` is defined,
the fast convex fill code from Chapter 39 is linked in and used to draw
convex polygons. Otherwise, convex polygons are handled as if they were
complex. Nonconvex polygons are also handled as complex, although this
is not necessary, as discussed shortly.

Listing 40.1 is a faithful implementation of the complex polygon filling
approach just described, with separate functions corresponding to each
of the tasks, such as building the GET and X-sorting the AET. Listing
40.2 provides the actual drawing code used to fill spans, built on a
draw pixel routine that is the only hardware dependency anywhere in the
C code. Listing 40.3 is the header file for the polygon filling code;
note that it is an expanded version of the header file used by the fast
convex polygon fill code from Chapter 39. (They may have the same name
but are *not* the same file!) Listing 40.4 is a sample program that,
when linked to Listings 40.1 and 40.2, demonstrates drawing polygons of
various sorts.

Listing 40.4 illustrates several interesting aspects of polygon filling.
The first and third polygons drawn illustrate the operation of the
odd/even fill rule. The second polygon drawn illustrates how holes can
be created in seemingly solid objects; an edge runs from the outside of
the rectangle to the inside, the edges comprising the hole are defined,
and then the same edge is used to move back to the outside; because the
edges join seamlessly, the rectangle appears to form a solid boundary
around the hole.

The set of V-shaped polygons drawn by Listing 40.4 demonstrate that
polygons sharing common edges meet but do not overlap. This
characteristic, which I discussed at length in Chapter 38, is not a
trivial matter; it allows polygons to fit together without fear of
overlapping or missed pixels. In general, Listing 40.1 guarantees that
polygons are filled such that common boundaries and vertices are drawn
once and only once. This has the side-effect for any individual polygon
of not drawing pixels that lie exactly on the bottom or right boundaries
or at vertices that terminate bottom or right boundaries.

By the way, I have not seen polygon boundary filling handled precisely
this way elsewhere. The boundary filling approach in Foley and van Dam
is similar, but seems to me to not draw all boundary and vertex pixels
once and only once.

#### More on Active Edges

Edges of zero height—horizontal edges and edges defined by two vertices
at the same location—never even make it into the GET in Listing 40.1. A
polygon edge of zero height can never be an active edge, because it can
never intersect a scan line; it can only run along the scan line, and
the span it runs along is defined not by that edge but by the edges that
connect to its endpoints.

#### Performance Considerations

How fast is Listing 40.1? When drawing triangles on a 20-MHz 386, it's
less than one-fifth the speed of the fast convex polygon fill code.
However, most of that time is spent drawing individual pixels; when
Listing 40.2 is replaced with the fast assembly line segment drawing
code in Listing 40.5, performance improves by two and one-half times, to
about half as fast as the fast convex fill code. Even after conversion
to assembly in Listing 40.5, `DrawHorizontalLineSeg` still takes more
than half of the total execution time, and the remaining time is spread
out fairly evenly over the various subroutines in Listing 40.1.
Consequently, there's no single place in which it's possible to greatly
improve performance, and the maximum additional improvement that's
possible looks to be a good deal less than two times; for that reason,
and because of space limitations, I'm not going to convert the rest of
the code to assembly. However, when filling a polygon with a great many
edges, and especially one with a great many active edges at one time,
relatively more time would be spent traversing the linked lists. In such
a case, conversion to assembly (which does a very good job with linked
list processing) could pay off reasonably well.

The algorithm used to X-sort the AET is an interesting performance
consideration. Listing 40.1 uses a bubble sort, usually a poor choice
for performance. However, bubble sorts perform well when the data are
already almost sorted, and because of the X coherence of edges from one
scan line to the next, that's generally the case with the AET. An
insertion sort might be somewhat faster, depending on the state of the
AET when any particular sort occurs, but a bubble sort will generally do
just fine.

An insertion sort that scans backward through the AET from the current
edge rather than forward from the start of the AET could be quite a bit
faster, because edges rarely move more than one or two positions through
the AET. However, scanning backward requires a doubly linked list,
rather than the singly linked list used in Listing 40.1. I've chosen to
use a singly linked list partly to minimize memory requirements
(double-linking requires an extra pointer field) and partly because
supporting back links would complicate the code a good bit. The main
reason, though, is that the potential rewards for the complications of
back links and insertion sorting aren't great enough; profiling a
variety of polygons reveals that less than ten percent of total time is
spent sorting the AET.

### Nonconvex Polygons

Nonconvex polygons can be filled somewhat faster than complex polygons.
Because edges never cross or switch positions with other edges once
they're in the AET, the AET for a nonconvex polygon needs to be sorted
only when new edges are added. In order for this to work, though, edges
must be added to the AET in strict left-to-right order. Complications
arise when dealing with two edges that start at the same point, because
slopes must be compared to determine which edge is leftmost. This is
certainly doable, but because of space limitations and limited
performance returns, I haven't implemented this in Listing 40.1.

#### Details, Details

Every so often, a programming demon that I'd thought I'd forever laid to
rest arises to haunt me once again. A minor example of this—an imp, if
you will—is the use of " = " when I mean " == ," which I've done all too
often in the past, and am sure I'll do again. That's minor deviltry,
though, compared to the considerably greater evils of one of my personal
scourges, of which I was recently reminded anew: too-close attention to
detail. Not seeing the forest for the trees. Looking low when I should
have looked high. Missing the big picture, if you catch my drift.

Thoreau said it best: "Our life is frittered away by detail....Simplify,
simplify." That quote sprang to mind when I received a letter a while
back from Anton Treuenfels of Fridley, Minnesota, thanking me for
clarifying the principles of filling adjacent convex polygons in my
ongoing writings on graphics programming. (You'll find this material in
the previous two chapters.) Anton then went on to describe his own
method for filling convex polygons.

Anton's approach had its virtues and drawbacks, foremost among the
virtues being a simplicity Thoreau would have admired. For instance, in
writing my polygon-filling code, I had spent quite some time trying to
figure out the best way to identify which edge was the left edge and
which the right, finally settling on comparing the slopes of the edges
if the top of the polygon wasn't flat, and comparing the starting points
of the edges if the top was flat. Anton simplified this tremendously by
not bothering to figure out ahead of time which was the right edge of
the polygon and which the left, instead scanning out the two edges in
whatever order he found them and letting the low-level drawing code
test, and if necessary swap, the endpoints of each horizontal line of
the fill, so that filling started at the leftmost edge. This is a little
slower than my approach (although the difference is almost surely
negligible), but it also makes quite a bit of code go away.

What that example, and others like it in Anton's letter, did was kick my
mind into a mode that it hadn't—but should have—been in when I wrote the
code, a mode in which I began to wonder, "How else can I simplify this
code?"; what you might call Occam's Razor mode. You see, I created the
convex polygon-drawing code by first writing pseudocode, then writing C
code, and finally writing assembly code, and once the pseudocode was
finished, I stopped thinking about the interactions of the various
portions of the program.

In other words, I became so absorbed in individual details that I forgot
to consider the code as a whole. That was a mistake, and an embarrassing
one for someone who constantly preaches that programmers should look at
their code from a variety of perspectives; the next chapter shows just
how much difference thinking about the big picture can make. May my
embarrassment be your enlightenment.

The point is not whether, in the final analysis, my code or Anton's code
is better; both have their advantages. The point is that I was
programming with half a deck because I was so fixated on the details of
a single type of implementation; I ended up with relatively
hard-to-write, complex code, and missed out on many potentially useful
optimizations by being so focused. It's a big world out there, and there
are many subtle approaches to any problem, so relax and keep the big
picture in mind as you implement your programs. Your code will likely be
not only better, but also simpler. And whenever you see me walking
across hot coals in this book or elsewhere when there's an easier way to
go, please, let me know!

Thanks, Anton.
