## Chapter 62 -- One Story, Two Rules, and a BSP Renderer

### Taking a Compiled BSP Tree from Logical to Visual Reality

As I've noted before, I'm working on Quake, id Software's follow-up to
DOOM. A month or so back, we added page flipping to Quake, and made the
startling discovery that the program ran nearly twice as fast with page
flipping as it did with the alternative method of drawing the whole
frame to system memory, then copying it to the screen. We were delighted
by this, but baffled. I did a few tests and came up with several
possible explanations, including slow writes through the external cache,
poor main memory performance, and cache misses when copying the frame
from system memory to video memory. Although each of these can indeed
affect performance, none seemed to account for the magnitude of the
speedup, so I assumed there was some hidden hardware interaction at
work. Anyway, "why" was secondary; what really mattered was that we had
a way to double performance, which meant I had a lot of work to do to
support page flipping as widely as possible.

A few days ago, I was using the Pentium's built-in performance counters
to seek out areas for improvement in Quake and, for no particular
reason, checked the number of writes performed while copying the frame
to the screen in non-page-flipped mode. The answer was 64,000. That
seemed odd, since there were 64,000 byte-sized pixels to copy, and I was
calling `memcpy()`, which of course performs copies a dword at a time
whenever possible. I thought maybe the Pentium counters report the
number of bytes written rather than the number of writes performed, but
fortunately, this time I tested my assumptions by writing an ASM routine
to copy the frame a dword at a time, without the help of `memcpy()`.
This time the Pentium counters reported 16,000 writes.

Whoops.

As it turns out, the `memcpy()` routine in the DOS version of our
compiler (gcc) inexplicably copies memory a byte at a time. With my new
routine, the non-page-flipped approach suddenly became slightly *faster*
than page flipping.

The first relevant rule is pretty obvious: *Assume nothing*. Measure
early and often. Know what's really going on when your program runs, if
you catch my drift. To do otherwise is to risk looking mighty foolish.

The second rule: When you do look foolish (and trust me, it *will*
happen if you do challenging work) have a good laugh at yourself, and
use it as a reminder of Rule \#1. I hadn't done any extra page-flipping
work yet, so I didn't waste any time due to my faulty assumption that
`memcpy()` performed a maximum-speed copy, but that was just luck. I
should have done experiments until I was sure I knew what was going on
before drawing any conclusions and acting on them.

By the way, I have found the Pentium's performance counters to be very
useful in of information on the performance counters and other aspects

Onward to rendering from a BSP tree.

#### BSP-based Rendering

For the last several chapters I've been discussing the nature of BSP
(Binary Space Partitioning) trees, and in Chapter 60 I presented a
compiler for 2-D BSP trees. Now we're ready to use those compiled BSP
trees to do realtime rendering.

As you'll recall, the BSP compiler took a list of vertical walls and
built a 2-D BSP tree from the walls, as viewed from above. The result is
shown in Figure 62.1. The world is split into two pieces by the line of
the root wall, and each half of the world is then split again by the
root's children, and so on, until the world is carved into subspaces
along the lines of all the walls.

![**Figure 62.1**  *Vertical walls and a BSP tree to represent them.*](../images/62-01.jpg)

Our objective is to draw the world so that whenever walls overlap we see
the nearer wall at each overlapped pixel. The simplest way to do that is
with the painter's algorithm; that is, drawing the walls in
back-to-front order, assuming no polygons interpenetrate or form cycles.
BSP trees guarantee that no polygons interpenetrate (such polygons are
automatically split), and make it easy to walk the polygons in
back-to-front (or front-to-back) order.

Given a BSP tree, in order to render a view of that tree, all we have to
do is descend the tree, deciding at each node whether we're seeing the
front or back of the wall at that node from the current viewpoint. We
use that knowledge to first recursively descend and draw the farther
subtree of that node, then draw that node, and finally draw the nearer
subtree of that node. Applied recursively from the root of our BSP
trees, this approach guarantees that overlapping polygons will always be
drawn in back-to-front order. Listing 62.1 draws a BSP-based world in
this fashion. (Because of the constraints of the printed page, Listing
62.1 is only the core of the BSP renderer, without the program
framework, some math routines, and the polygon rasterizer; but, the
entire program is on the CD-ROM as DDJBSP2.ZIP. Listing 62.1 is in a
compressed format, with relatively little whitespace; the full version
on the CD-ROM is formatted normally.)

#### The Rendering Pipeline

Conceptually rendering from a BSP tree really is that simple, but the
implementation is a bit more complicated. The full rendering pipeline,
as coordinated by `UpdateWorld()`, is this:

  * Update the current location.
  * Transform all wall endpoints into viewspace (the world as seen from
    the current location with the current viewing angle).
  * Clip all walls to the view pyramid.
  * Project wall vertices to screen coordinates.
  * Walk the walls back to front, and for each wall that lies at least
    partially in the view pyramid, perform backface culling (skip walls
    facing away from the viewer), and draw the wall if it's not culled.

Next, we'll look at each part of the pipeline more closely. The pipeline
is too complex for me to be able to discuss each part in complete
detail. Some sources for further reading are *Computer Graphics*, by
Foley and van Dam (ISBN 0-201-12110-7), and the *DDJ Essential Books on
Graphics Programming* CD.

### Moving the Viewer

The sample BSP program performs first-person rendering; that is, it
renders the world as seen from your eyes as you move about. The rate of
movement is controlled by key-handling code that's not shown in Listing
62.1; however, the variables set by the key-handling code are used in
`UpdateViewPos()` to bring the current location up to date.

Note that the view position can change not only in x and z (movement
around the but only viewing horizontally. Although the BSP tree is only
2-D, it is quite possible to support looking up and down to at least
some extent, particularly if the world dataset is restricted so that,
for example, there are never two rooms stacked on top of each other, or
any tilted walls. For simplicity's sake, I have chosen not to implement
this in Listing 62.1, but you may find it educational to add it to the
program yourself.

### Transformation into Viewspace

The viewing angle (which controls direction of movement as well as view
direction) can sweep through the full 360 degrees around the viewpoint,
so long as it remains horizontal. The viewing angle is controlled by the
key handler, and is used to define a unit vector stored in
`currentorientation` that explicitly defines the view direction (the z
axis of viewspace), and implicitly defines the x axis of viewspace,
because that axis is at right angles to the z axis, where x increases to
the right of the viewer.

As I discussed in the previous chapter, rotation to a new coordinate
system can be performed by using the dot product to project points onto
the axes of the new coordinate system, and that's what
`TransformVertices()` does, after first translating (moving) the
coordinate system to have its origin at the viewpoint. (It's necessary
to perform the translation first so that the viewing rotation is around
the viewpoint.) Note that this operation can equivalently be viewed as a
matrix math operation, and that this is in fact the more common way to
handle transformations.

At the same time, the points are scaled in x according to
`PROJECTION_RATIO` to provide the desired field of view. Larger scale
values result in narrower fields of view.

When this is done the walls are in viewspace, ready to be clipped.

### Clipping

In viewspace, the walls may be anywhere relative to the viewpoint: in
front, behind, off to the side. We only want to draw those parts of
walls that properly belong on the screen; that is, those parts that lie
in the view pyramid (view frustum), as shown in Figure 62.2. Unclipped
walls—walls that lie entirely in the frustum—should be drawn in their
entirety, fully clipped walls should not be drawn, and partially clipped
walls must be trimmed before being drawn.

In Listing 62.1, `ClipWalls()` does this in three steps for each wall
in turn. First, the z coordinates of the two ends of the wall are
calculated. (Remember, walls are vertical and their ends go straight up
and down, so the top and bottom of each end have the same x and z
coordinates.) If both ends are on the near side of the front clip plane,
then the polygon is fully clipped, and we're done with it. If both ends
are on the far side, then the polygon isn't z-clipped, and we leave it
unchanged. If the polygon straddles the near clip plane, then the wall
is trimmed to stop at the near clip plane by adjusting the t value of
the nearest endpoint appropriately; this calculation is a simple matter
of scaling by z, because the near clip plane is at a constant z
distance. (The use of t values for parametric lines was discussed in
Chapter 60.) The process is further simplified because the walls can be
treated as lines viewed from above, so we can perform 2-D clipping in z;
this would not be the case if walls sloped or had sloping edges.

After clipping in z, we clip by viewspace x coordinate, to ensure that
we draw only wall portions that lie between the left and right edges of
the screen. Like z-clipping, x-clipping can be done as a 2-D clip,
because the walls and the left and right sides of the frustum are all
vertical. We compare both the start and endpoint of each wall to the
left and right sides of the frustum, and reject, accept, or clip each
wall's t values accordingly. The test for x clipping is very simple,
because the edges of the frustum are defined as the planes where x==z
and -x==z.

![**Figure 62.2**  *Clipping to the view pyramid.*](../images/62-02.jpg)

The final clip stage is clipping by y coordinate, and this is the most
complicated, because vertical walls can be clipped at an angle in y, as
shown in Figure 62.3, so true 3-D clipping of all four wall vertices is
involved. We handle this in `ClipWalls()` by detecting trivial
rejection in y, using y==z and ==z as the y boundaries of the frustum.
However, we leave partial clipping to be handled as a 2-D clipping
problem; we are able to do this only because our earlier z-clip to the
near clip plane guarantees that no remaining polygon point can have
z\<=0, ensuring that when we project we'll always pass valid,
y-clippable screenspace vertices to the polygon filler.

### Projection to Screenspace

At this point, we have viewspace vertices for each wall that's at least
partially visible. All we have to do is project these vertices according
to z distance—that is, perform perspective projection—and scale the
results to the width of the screen, then we'll be ready to draw.
Although this step is logically separate from clipping, it is performed
as the last step for visible walls in `ClipWalls()`.

![**Figure 62.3**  *Why y clipping is more complex than x or z clipping.*](../images/62-03.jpg)

### Walking the Tree, Backface Culling and Drawing

Now that we have all the walls clipped to the frustum, with vertices
projected into screen coordinates, all we have to do is draw them back
to front; that's the job of `DrawWallsBackToFront()`. Basically, this
routine walks the BSP tree, descending recursively from each node to
draw the farther children of each node first, then the wall at the node,
then the nearer children. In the interests of efficiency, this
particular implementation performs a data-recursive walk of the tree,
rather than the more familiar code recursion. Interestingly, the
performance speedup from data recursion turned out to be more modest
than I had expected, based on past experience; see Chapter 59 for
further details.

As it comes to each wall, `DrawWallsBackToFront()` first descends to
draw the farther subtree. Next, if the wall is both visible and pointing
toward the viewer, it is drawn as a solid polygon. The polygon filler
(not shown in Listing 62.1) is a modification of the polygon filler I
presented in Chapters 38 and 39.

It's worth noting how backface culling and front/back wall orientation
testing are performed. (Note that walls are always one-sided, visible
only from the front.) I discussed backface culling in general in the
previous chapter, and mentioned two possible approaches: generating a
screenspace normal (perpendicular vector) to the polygon and seeing
which way that points, or taking the world or screenspace dot product
between the vector from the viewpoint to any polygon point and the
polygon's normal and checking the sign. Listing 62.1 does both, but
because our BSP tree is 2-D and the viewer is always upright, we can
save some work.

Consider this: Walls are stored so that the left end, as viewed from the
front side of the wall, is the start vertex, and the right end is the
end vertex. There are only two possible ways that a wall can be
positioned in screenspace, then: viewed from the front, in which case
the start vertex is to the left of the end vertex, or viewed from the
back, in which case the start vertex is to the right of the end vertex,
as shown in Figure 62.4. So we can tell which side of a wall we're
seeing, and thus backface cull, simply by comparing the screenspace x
coordinates of the start and end vertices, a simple 2-D version of
checking the direction of the screenspace normal.

The wall orinetation test used for walking the BSP tree, performed in
`WallFacingViewer()` takes the other approach, and checks the
viewspace sign of the dot product of the wall's normal with a vector
from the viewpoint to the wall. Again, this code takes advantage of the
2-D nature of the tree to generate the wall normal by swapping x and z
and altering signs. We can't use the quicker screenspace x test here
that we used for backface culling, because not all walls can be
projected into screenspace; for example, trying to project a wall at
z==0 would result in division by zero.

All the visible, front-facing walls are drawn into a buffer by
`DrawWallsBackToFront()`, then `UpdateWorld()` calls Win32 to copy
the new frame to the screen. The frame of animation is complete.

#### Notes on the BSP Renderer

Listing 62.1 is far from complete or optimal. There is no such thing as
a tiny BSP rendering demo, because 3D rendering, even when based on a
2-D BSP tree, requires a substantial amount of code and complexity.
Listing 62.1 is reasonably close to a minimum rendering engine, and is
specifically intended to illuminate basic BSP principles, given the
space limitations of one chapter in a book that's already larger than it
should be. Think of Listing 62.1 as a learning tool and a starting
point.

The most obvious lack in Listing 62.1 is that there is no support for
floors and ceilings; the walls float in space, unsupported. Is it
necessary to go to 3-D BSP trees to get a normal-looking world?

No. Although 3-D BSP trees offer many advantages in that they allow
arbitrary datasets with viewing in any arbitrary direction and, in
truth, aren't much more complicated than 2-D BSP trees for back-to-front
drawing, they do tend to be larger and more difficult to debug, and they
aren't necessary for floors and ceilings. One way to get floors and
ceilings out of a 2-D BSP tree is to change the nature of the BSP tree
so that polygons are no longer stored in the splitting nodes. Instead,
each leaf of the tree—that is, each subspace carved out by the
tree—would store the polygons for the walls, floors, and ceilings that
lie on the boundaries of that space and face into that space. The
subspace would be convex, because all BSP subspaces are automatically
convex, so the polygons in that subspace can be drawn in any order.
Thus, the subspaces in the BSP tree would each be drawn in turn as
convex sets, back to front, just as Listing 62.1 draws polygons back to
front.

This sort of BSP tree, organized around volumes rather than polygons,
has some additional interesting advantages in simulating physics,
detecting collisions, doing line-of-sight determination, and performing
volume-based operations such as dynamic illumination and event
triggering. However, that discussion will have to wait until another
day.
