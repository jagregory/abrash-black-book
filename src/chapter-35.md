## Chapter 35 -- Bresenham Is Fast, and Fast Is Good

### Implementing and Optimizing Bresenham's Line-Drawing Algorithm

For all the complexity of graphics design and programming, surprisingly
few primitive functions lie at the heart of most graphics software.
Heavily used primitives include routines that draw dots, circles, area
fills, bit block logical transfers, and, of course, lines. For many
years, computer graphics were created primarily with specialized
line-drawing hardware, so lines are in a way the *lingua franca* of
computer graphics. Lines are used in a wide variety of microcomputer
graphics applications today, notably CAD/CAM and computer-aided
engineering.

Probably the best-known formula for drawing lines on a computer display
is called Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm. (We have to be specific
here because there is also a less-well-known Bresenham's circle-drawing
algorithm.) In this chapter, I'll present two implementations for the
EGA and VGA of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm, which provides decent
line quality and excellent drawing speed.

The first implementation is in rather plain C, with the second in
not-so-plain assembly, and they're both pretty good code. The assembly
implementation is damned good code, in fact, but if you want to know
whether it's the fastest Bresenham's implementation possible, I must
tell you that it isn't. First of all, the code could be sped up a bit by
shuffling and combining the various error-term manipulations, but that
results in *truly* cryptic code. I wanted you to be able to relate the
original algorithm to the final code, so I skipped those optimizations.
Also, write mode 3, which is unique to the VGA, could be used for
considerably faster drawing. I've described write mode 3 in earlier
chapters, and I strongly recommend its use in VGA-only line drawing.

Second, horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines could be special-cased,
since those particular lines require little calculation and can be drawn
very rapidly. (This is especially true of horizontal lines, which can be
drawn 8 pixels at a time.)

Third, run-length slice line drawing could be used to significantly
reduce the number of calculations required per pixel, as I'll
demonstrate in the next two chapters.

Finally, unrolled loops and/or duplicated code could be used to
eliminate most of the branches in the final assembly implementation, and
because x86 processors are notoriously slow at branching, that would
make quite a difference in overall performance. If you're interested in
unrolled loops and similar assembly techniques, I refer you to the first
part of this book.

That brings us neatly to my final point: Even if I didn't know that
there were further optimizations to be made to my line-drawing
implementation, I'd *assume* that there were. As I'm sure the
experienced assembly programmers among you know, there are dozens of
ways to tackle any problem in assembly, and someone else always seems to
have come up with a trick that never occurred to you. I've incorporated
a suggestion made by Jim Mackraz in the code in this chapter, and I'd be
most interested in hearing of any other tricks or tips you may have.

Notwithstanding, the line-drawing implementation in Listing 35.3 is
plenty fast enough for most purposes, so let's get the discussion
underway.

### The Task at Hand

There are two important characteristics of any line-drawing function.
First, it must draw a reasonable approximation of a line. A computer
screen has limited resolution, and so a line-drawing function must
actually approximate a straight line by drawing a series of pixels in
what amounts to a jagged pattern that generally proceeds in the desired
direction. That pattern of pixels must reliably suggest to the human eye
the true line it represents. Second, to be usable, a line-drawing
function must be *fast*. Minicomputers and mainframes generally have
hardware that performs line drawing, but most microcomputers offer no
such assistance. True, nowadays graphics accelerators such as the S3 and
ATI chips have line drawing hardware, but some other accelerators don't;
when drawing lines on the latter sort of chip, when drawing on the CGA,
EGA, and VGA, and when drawing sorts of lines not supported by
line-drawing hardware as well, the PC's CPU must draw lines on its own,
and, as many users of graphics-oriented software know, that can be a
slow process indeed.

Line drawing quality and speed derive from two factors: The algorithm
used to draw the line and the implementation of that algorithm. The
first implementation (written in Borland C++) that I'll be presenting in
this chapter illustrates the workings of the algorithm and draws lines
at a good rate. The second implementation, written in assembly language
and callable directly from Borland C++, draws lines at extremely high
speed, on the order of three to six times faster than the C version.
Between them, the two implementations illuminate Bresenham's
line-drawing algorithm and provide high-performance line-drawing
capability.

The difficulty in drawing a line lies in generating a set of pixels
that, taken together, are a reasonable facsimile of a true line. Only
horizontal, vertical, and 1:1 diagonal lines can be drawn precisely
along the true line being represented; all other lines must be
approximated from the array of pixels that a given video mode supports,
as shown in Figure 35.1.

Considerable thought has gone into the design of line-drawing
algorithms, and a number of techniques for drawing high-quality lines
have been developed. Unfortunately, most of these techniques were
developed for powerful, expensive graphics workstations and require very
high resolution, a large color palette, and/or floating-point hardware.
These techniques tend to perform poorly and produce less visually
impressive results on all but the best-endowed PCs.

Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm, on the other hand, is uniquely
suited to microcomputer implementation in that it requires no
floating-point operations, no divides, and no multiplies inside the
line-drawing loop. Moreover, it can be implemented with surprisingly
little code.

### Bresenham's Line-Drawing Algorithm

The key to grasping Bresenham's algorithm is to understand that when
drawing an approximation of a line on a finite-resolution display, each
pixel drawn will lie either exactly on the true line or to one side or
the other of the true line. The amount by which the pixel actually drawn
deviates from the true line is the *error* of the line drawing at that
point. As the drawing of the line progresses from one pixel to the next,
the error can be used to tell when, given the resolution of the display,
a more accurate approximation of the line can be drawn by placing a
given pixel one unit of screen resolution away from its predecessor in
either the horizontal or the vertical direction, or both.

![**Figure 35.1**  *Approximating a true line from a pixel array.*](../images/35-01.jpg)

Let's examine the case of drawing a line where the horizontal, or X
length of the line is greater than the vertical, or Y length, and both
lengths are greater than 0. For example, suppose we are drawing a line
from (0,0) to (5,2), as shown in Figure 35.2. Note that Figure 35.2
shows the upper-left-hand corner of the screen as (0,0), rather than
placing (0,0) at its more traditional lower-left-hand corner location.
Due to the way in which the PC's graphics are mapped to memory, it is
simpler to work within this framework, although a translation of Y from
increasing downward to increasing upward could be effected easily enough
by simply subtracting the Y coordinate from the screen height minus 1;
if you are more comfortable with the traditional coordinate system, feel
free to modify the code in Listings 35.1 and 35.3.

In Figure 35.2, the endpoints of the line fall exactly on displayed
pixels. However, no other part of the line squarely intersects the
center of a pixel, meaning that all other pixels will have to be plotted
as approximations of the line. The approach to approximation that
Bresenham's algorithm takes is to move exactly 1 pixel along the major
dimension of the line each time a new pixel is drawn, while moving 1
pixel along the minor dimension each time the line moves more than
halfway between pixels along the minor dimension.

In Figure 35.2, the X dimension is the major dimension. This means that
6 dots, one at each of X coordinates 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, will be
drawn. The trick, then, is to decide on the correct Y coordinates to
accompany those X coordinates.

![**Figure 35.2**  *Drawing between two pixel endpoints.*](../images/35-02.jpg)

It's easy enough to select the Y coordinates by eye in Figure 35.2. The
appropriate Y coordinates are 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, based on the Y
coordinate closest to the line for each X coordinate. Bresenham's
algorithm makes the same selections, based on the same criterion. The
manner in which it does this is by keeping a running record of the error
of the line—that is, how far from the true line the current Y coordinate
is—at each X coordinate, as shown in Figure 35.3. When the running error
of the line indicates that the current Y coordinate deviates from the
true line to the extent that the adjacent Y coordinate would be closer
to the line, then the current Y coordinate is changed to that adjacent Y
coordinate.

Let's take a moment to follow the steps Bresenham's algorithm would go
through in drawing the line in Figure 35.3. The initial pixel is drawn
at (0,0), the starting point of the line. At this point the error of the
line is 0.

Since X is the major dimension, the next pixel has an X coordinate of 1.
The Y coordinate of this pixel will be whichever of 0 (the last Y
coordinate) or 1 (the adjacent Y coordinate in the direction of the end
point of the line) the true line at this X coordinate is closer to. The
running error at this point is B minus A, as shown in Figure 35.3. This
amount is less than 1/2 (that is, less than halfway to the next Y
coordinate), so the Y coordinate does not change at X equal to 1.
Consequently, the second pixel is drawn at (1,0).

The third pixel has an X coordinate of 2. The running error at this
point is C minus A, which is greater than 1/2 and therefore closer to
the next than to the current Y coordinate. The third pixel is drawn at
(2,1), and 1 is subtracted from the running error to compensate for the
adjustment of one pixel in the current Y coordinate. The running error
of the pixel actually drawn at this point is C minus D.

![**Figure 35.3**  *The error term in Bresenham's algorithm.*](../images/35-03.jpg)

The fourth pixel has an X coordinate of 3. The running error at this
point is E minus D; since this is less than 1/2, the current Y
coordinate doesn't change. The fourth pixel is drawn at (3,1).

The fifth pixel has an X coordinate of 4. The running error at this
point is F minus D; since this is greater than 1/2, the current Y
coordinate advances. The third pixel is drawn at (4,2), and 1 is
subtracted from the running error. The error of the pixel drawn at this
point is G minus F.

Finally, the sixth pixel is the end point of the line. This pixel has an
X coordinate of 5. The running error at this point is G minus G, or 0,
indicating that this point is squarely on the true line, as of course it
should be given that it's the end point, so the current Y coordinate
remains the same. The end point of the line is drawn at (5,2), and the
line is complete.

That's really all there is to Bresenham's algorithm. The algorithm is a
process of drawing a pixel at each possible coordinate along the major
dimension of the line, each with the closest possible coordinate along
the minor dimension. The running error is used to keep track of when the
coordinate along the minor dimension must change in order to remain as
close as possible to the true line. The above description of the case
where X is the major dimension, Y is the minor dimension, and both
dimensions are greater than zero is readily generalized to all eight
octants in which lines could be drawn, as we will see in the C
implementation.

The above discussion summarizes the nature rather than the exact
mechanism of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm. I'll provide a brief
seat-of-the-pants discussion of the algorithm in action when we get to
the C implementation of the algorithm; for a full mathematical
treatment, I refer you to pages 433-436 of Foley and Van Dam's
*Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics* (Addison-Wesley, 1982),
or pages 72-78 of the second edition of that book, which was published
under the name *Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice*
(Addison-Wesley, 1990). These sources provide the derivation of the
integer-only, divide-free version of the algorithm, as well as Pascal
code for drawing lines in one of the eight possible octants.

#### Strengths and Weaknesses

The overwhelming strength of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm is
speed. With no divides, no floating-point operations, and no need for
variables that won't fit in 16 bits, it is perfectly suited for PCs.

The weakness of Bresenham's algorithm is that it produces relatively
low-quality lines by comparison with most other line-drawing algorithms.
In particular, lines generated with Bresenham's algorithm can tend to
look a little jagged. On the PC, however, jagged lines are an inevitable
consequence of relatively low resolution and a small color set, so lines
drawn with Bresenham's algorithm don't look all that much different from
lines drawn in other ways. Besides, in most applications, users are far
more interested in the overall picture than in the primitive elements
from which that picture is built. As a general rule, any collection of
pixels that trend from point A to point B in a straight fashion is
accepted by the eye as a line. Bresenham's algorithm is successfully
used by many current PC programs, and by the standard of this wide
acceptance the algorithm is certainly good enough.

Then, too, users hate waiting for their computer to finish drawing. By
any standard of drawing performance, Bresenham's algorithm excels.

### An Implementation in C

It's time to get down and look at some actual working code. Listing 35.1
is a C implementation of Bresenham's line-drawing algorithm for modes
0EH, 0FH, 10H, and 12H of the VGA, called as function `EVGALine`.
Listing 35.2 is a sample program to demonstrate the use of `EVGALine`.

#### Looking at EVGALine

The `EVGALine` function itself performs four operations. `EVGALine`
first sets up the VGA's hardware so that all pixels drawn will be in the
desired color. This is accomplished by setting two of the VGA's
registers, the Enable Set/Reset register and the Set/Reset register.
Setting the Enable Set/Reset to the value 0FH, as is done in
`EVGALine`, causes all drawing to produce pixels in the color
contained in the Set/Reset register. Setting the Set/Reset register to
the passed color, in conjunction with the Enable Set/Reset setting of
0FH, causes all drawing done by `EVGALine` and the functions it calls
to generate the passed color. In summary, setting up the Enable
Set/Reset and Set/Reset registers in this way causes the remainder of
`EVGALine` to draw a line in the specified color.

`EVGALine` next performs a simple check to cut in half the number of
line orientations that must be handled separately. Figure 35.4 shows the
eight possible line orientations among which a Bresenham's algorithm
implementation must distinguish. (In interpreting Figure 35.4, assume
that lines radiate outward from the center of the figure, falling into
one of eight octants delineated by the horizontal and vertical axes and
the two diagonals.) The need to categorize lines into these octants
falls out of the major/minor axis nature of the algorithm; the
orientations are distinguished by which coordinate forms the major axis
and by whether each of X and Y increases or decreases from the line
start to the line end.

This accomplished, `EVGALine` must still distinguish among the four
remaining line orientations. Those four orientations form two major
categories, orientations for which the X dimension is the major axis of
the line and orientations for which the Y dimension is the major axis.
As shown in Figure 35.4, octants 1 (where X increases from start to
finish) and 2 (where X decreases from start to finish) fall into the
latter category, and differ in only one respect, the direction in which
the X coordinate moves when it changes. Handling of the running error of
the line is exactly the same for both cases, as one would expect given
the symmetry of lines differing only in the sign of `DeltaX`, the X
coordinate of the line. Consequently, for those cases where `DeltaX`
is less than zero, the direction of X movement is made negative, and the
absolute value of `DeltaX` is used for error term calculations.

Similarly, octants 0 (where X increases from start to finish) and 3
(where X decreases from start to finish) differ only in the direction in
which the X coordinate moves when it changes. The difference between
line drawing in octants 0 and 3 and line drawing in octants 1 and 2 is
that in octants 0 and 3, since X is the major axis, the X coordinate
changes on every pixel of the line and the Y coordinate changes only
when the running error of the line dictates. In octants 1 and 2, the Y
coordinate changes on every pixel and the X coordinate changes only when
the running error dictates, since Y is the major axis.

![**Figure 35.4**  *Bresenham's eight possible line orientations.*](../images/35-04.jpg)

There is one line-drawing function for octants 0 and 3, `Octant0`, and
one line-drawing function for octants 1 and 2, `Octant1`. A single
function with `if` statements could certainly be used to handle all
four octants, but at a significant performance cost. There is, on the
other hand, very little performance cost to grouping octants 0 and 3
together and octants 1 and 2 together, since the two octants in each
pair differ only in the direction of change of the X coordinate.

`EVGALine` determines which line-drawing function to call and with
what value for the direction of change of the X coordinate based on two
criteria: whether `DeltaX` is negative or not, and whether the
absolute value of `DeltaX` (|`DeltaX`|) is less than `DeltaY` or
not, as shown in Figure 35.5. Recall that the value of `DeltaY`, and
hence the direction of change of the Y coordinate, is guaranteed to be
non-negative as a result of the earlier elimination of four of the line
orientations.

After calling the appropriate function to draw the line (more on those
functions shortly), `EVGALine` restores the state of the Enable
Set/Reset register to its default of zero. In this state, the Set/Reset
register has no effect, so it is not necessary to restore the state of
the Set/Reset register as well. `EVGALine` also restores the state of
the Bit Mask register (which, as we will see, is modified by
`EVGADot`, the pixel-drawing routine actually used to draw each pixel
of the lines produced by `EVGALine`) to its default of 0FFH. While it
would be more modular to have `EVGADot` restore the state of the Bit
Mask register after drawing each pixel, it would also be considerably
slower to do so. The same could be said of having `EVGADot` set the
Enable Set/Reset and Set/Reset registers for each pixel: While
modularity would improve, speed would suffer markedly.

#### Drawing Each Line

The `Octant0` and `Octant1` functions draw lines for which
|`DeltaX`| is greater than `DeltaY` and lines for which |`DeltaX`|
is less than or equal to `DeltaY`, respectively. The parameters to
`Octant0` and `Octant1` are the starting point of the line, the
length of the line in each dimension, and `XDirection`, the amount by
which the X coordinate should be changed when it moves. `XDirection`
must be either 1 (to draw toward the right edge of the screen) or -1 (to
draw toward the left edge of the screen). No value is required for the
amount by which the Y coordinate should be changed; since `DeltaY` is
guaranteed to be positive, the Y coordinate always changes by 1 pixel.

`Octant0` draws lines for which |`DeltaX`| is greater than
`DeltaY`. For such lines, the X coordinate of each pixel drawn differs
from the previous pixel by either 1 or -1, depending on the value of
`XDirection`. (This makes it possible for `Octant0` to draw lines in
both octant 0 and octant 3.) Whenever `ErrorTerm` becomes
non-negative, indicating that the next Y coordinate is a better
approximation of the line being drawn, the Y coordinate is increased by
1.

`Octant1` draws lines for which |`DeltaX`| is less than or equal to
DeltaY. For these lines, the Y coordinate of each pixel drawn is 1
greater than the Y coordinate of the previous pixel. Whenever
`ErrorTerm` becomes non-negative, indicating that the next X
coordinate is a better approximation of the line being drawn, the X
coordinate is advanced by either 1 or -1, depending on the value of
`XDirection`. (This makes it possible for `Octant1` to draw lines in
both octant 1 and octant 2.)

#### Drawing Each Pixel

At the core of `Octant0` and `Octant1` is a pixel-drawing function,
`EVGADot`. `EVGADot` draws a pixel at the specified coordinates in
whatever color the hardware of the VGA happens to be set up for. As
described earlier, since the entire line drawn by `EVGALine` is of the
same color, line-drawing performance is improved by setting the VGA's
hardware up once in `EVGALine` before the line is drawn, and then
drawing all the pixels in the line in the same color via `EVGADot`.

`EVGADot` makes certain assumptions about the screen. First, it
assumes that the address of the byte controlling the pixels at the start
of a given row on the screen is 80 bytes after the start of the row
immediately above it. In other words, this implementation of `EVGADot`
only works for screens configured to be 80 bytes wide. Since this is the
standard configuration of all of the modes `EVGALine` is designed to
work in, the assumption of 80 bytes per row should be no problem. If it
is a problem, however, `EVGADot` could easily be modified to retrieve
the BIOS integer variable at address 0040:004A, which contains the
number of bytes per row for the current video mode.

Second, `EVGADot` assumes that screen memory is organized as a linear
bitmap starting at address A000:0000, with the pixel at the upper left
of the screen controlled by bit 7 of the byte at offset 0, the next
pixel to the right controlled by bit 6, the ninth pixel controlled by
bit 7 of the byte at offset 1, and so on. Further, it assumes that the
graphics adapter's hardware is configured such that setting the Bit Mask
register to allow modification of only the bit controlling the pixel of
interest and then ORing a value of 0FEH with display memory will draw
that pixel correctly without affecting any other dots. (Note that 0FEH
is used rather than 0FFH or 0 because some optimizing compilers turn ORs
with the latter values into simpler operations or optimize them away
entirely. As explained later, however, it's not the value that's ORed
that matters, given the way we've set up the VGA's hardware; it's the
act of ORing itself, and the value 0FEH forces the compiler to perform
the OR operation.) Again, this is the normal way in which modes 0EH,
0FH, 10H, and 12H operate. As described earlier, `EVGADot` also
assumes that the VGA is set up so that each pixel drawn in the
above-mentioned manner will be drawn in the correct color.

Given those assumptions, `EVGADot` becomes a surprisingly simple
function. First, `EVGADot` builds a far pointer that points to the
byte of display memory controlling the pixel to be drawn. Second, a mask
is generated consisting of zeros for all bits except the bit controlling
the pixel to be drawn. Third, the Bit Mask register is set to that mask,
so that when display memory is read and then written, all bits except
the one that controls the pixel to be drawn will be left unmodified.

Finally, 0FEH is ORed with the display memory byte controlling the pixel
to be drawn. ORing with 0FEH first reads display memory, thereby loading
the VGA's internal latches with the contents of the display memory byte
controlling the pixel to be drawn, and then writes to display memory
with the value 0FEH. Because of the unusual way in which the VGA's data
paths work and the way in which `EVGALine` sets up the VGA's Enable
Set/Reset and Set/Reset registers, the value that is written by the
`OR` instruction is ignored. Instead, the value that actually gets
placed in display memory is the color that was passed to `EVGALine`
and placed in the Set/Reset register. The Bit Mask register, which was
set up in step three above, allows only the single bit controlling the
pixel to be drawn to be set to this color value. For more on the various
machineries the VGA brings to bear on graphics data, look back to
Chapter 25.

The result of all this is simply a single pixel drawn in the color set
up in `EVGALine`. `EVGADot` may seem excessively complex for a
function that does nothing more that draw one pixel, but programming the
VGA isn't trivial (as we've seen in the early chapters of this part).
Besides, while the explanation of `EVGADot` is lengthy, the code
itself is only five lines long.

Line drawing would be somewhat faster if the code of `EVGADot` were
made an inline part of `Octant0` and `Octant1`, thereby saving the
overhead of preparing parameters and calling the function. Feel free to
do this if you wish; I maintained `EVGADot` as a separate function for
clarity and for ease of inserting a pixel-drawing function for a
different graphics adapter, should that be desired. If you do install a
pixel-drawing function for a different adapter, or a fundamentally
different mode such as a 256-color SuperVGA mode, remember to remove the
hardware-dependent `outportb` lines in `EVGALine` itself.

### Comments on the C Implementation

`EVGALine` does no error checking whatsoever. My assumption in writing
`EVGALine` was that it would be ultimately used as the lowest-level
primitive of a graphics software package, with operations such as error
checking and clipping performed at a higher level. Similarly,
`EVGALine` is tied to the VGA's screen coordinate system of (0,0) to
(639,199) (in mode 0EH), (0,0) to (639,349) (in modes 0FH and 10H), or
(0,0) to (639,479) (in mode 12H), with the upper left corner considered
to be (0,0). Again, transformation from any coordinate system to the
coordinate system used by `EVGALine` can be performed at a higher
level. `EVGALine` is specifically designed to do one thing: draw lines
into the display memory of the VGA. Additional functionality can be
supplied by the code that calls `EVGALine`.

The version of `EVGALine` shown in Listing 35.1 is reasonably fast,
but it is not as fast as it might be. Inclusion of `EVGADot` directly
into `Octant0` and `Octant1`, and, indeed, inclusion of `Octant0`
and `Octant1` directly into `EVGALine` would speed execution by
saving the overhead of calling and parameter passing. Handpicked
register variables might speed performance as well, as would the use of
word `OUT`s rather than byte `OUT`s. A more significant performance
increase would come from eliminating separate calculation of the address
and mask for each pixel. Since the location of each pixel relative to
the previous pixel is known, the address and mask could simply be
adjusted from one pixel to the next, rather than recalculated from
scratch.

These enhancements are not incorporated into the code in Listing 35.1
for a couple of reasons. One reason is that it's important that the
workings of the algorithm be clearly visible in the code, for learning
purposes. Once the implementation is understood, rewriting it for
improved performance would certainly be a worthwhile exercise. Another
reason is that when flat-out speed is needed, assembly language is the
best way to go. Why produce hard-to-understand C code to boost speed a
bit when assembly-language code can perform the same task at two or more
times the speed?

Given which, a high-speed assembly language version of `EVGALine`
would seem to be a logical next step.

### Bresenham's Algorithm in Assembly

Listing 35.3 is a high-performance implementation of Bresenham's
algorithm, written entirely in assembly language. The code is callable
from C just as is Listing 35.1, with the same name, `EVGALine`, and
with the same parameters. Either of the two can be linked to any program
that calls `EVGALine`, since they appear to be identical to the
calling program. The only difference between the two versions is that
the sample program in Listing 35.2 runs over three times as fast on a
486 with an ISA-bus VGA when calling the assembly-language version of
`EVGALine` as when calling the C version, and the difference would be
considerably greater yet on a local bus, or with the use of write mode
3. Link each version with Listing 35.2 and compare performance—the
difference is startling.

An explanation of the workings of the code in Listing 35.3 would be a
lengthy one, and would be redundant since the basic operation of the
code in Listing 35.3 is no different from that of the code in Listing
35.1, although the implementation is much changed due to the nature of
assembly language and also due to designing for speed rather than for
clarity. Given that you thoroughly understand the C implementation in
Listing 35.1, the assembly language implementation in Listing 35.3,
which is well-commented, should speak for itself.

One point I do want to make is that Listing 35.3 incorporates a clever
notion for which credit is due Jim Mackraz, who described the notion in
a letter written in response to an article I wrote long ago in the late
and lamented *Programmer's Journal*. Jim's suggestion was that when
drawing lines for which |`DeltaX`| is greater than |`DeltaY`|, bits
set to 1 for each of the pixels controlled by a given byte can be
accumulated in a register, rather than drawing each pixel individually.
All the pixels controlled by that byte can then be drawn at once, with a
single access to display memory, when all pixel processing associated
with that byte has been completed. This approach can save many `OUT`s
and many display memory reads and writes when drawing nearly-horizontal
lines, and that's important because EGAs and VGAs hold the CPU up for a
considerable period of time on each I/O operation and display memory
access.

All too many PC programmers fall into the high-level-language trap of
thinking that a good algorithm guarantees good performance. Not so: As
our two implementations of Bresenham's algorithm graphically illustrate
(pun not originally intended, but allowed to stand once recognized),
truly great PC code requires both a good algorithm *and* a good assembly
implementation. In Listing 35.3, we've got y-oh-my, isn't it fun?
