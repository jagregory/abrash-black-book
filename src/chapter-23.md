# Part II

## Chapter 23 -- Bones and Sinew

### At the Very Heart of Standard PC Graphics

The VGA is unparalleled in the history of computer graphics, for it is
by far the most widely-used graphics standard ever, the closest we may
ever come to a *lingua franca* of computer graphics. No other graphics
standard has even come close to the 50,000,000 or so VGAs in use today,
and virtually every PC compatible sold today has full VGA compatibility
built in. There are, of course, a variety of graphics accelerators that
outperform the standard VGA, and indeed, it is becoming hard to find a
plain vanilla VGA anymore—but there is no standard for accelerators, and
every accelerator contains a true-blue VGA at its core.

What that means is that if you write your programs for the VGA, you'll
have the largest possible market for your software. In order for
graphics-based software to succeed, however, it must perform well.
Wringing the best performance from the VGA is no simple task, and it's
*impossible* unless you really understand how the VGA works—unless you
have the internals down cold. This book is about PC graphics at many
levels, but high performance is the foundation for all that is to come,
so it is with the inner workings of the VGA that we will begin our
exploration of PC graphics.

The first eight chapters of Part II is a guided tour of the heart of the
VGA; after you've absorbed what we'll cover in this and the next seven
chapters, you'll have the foundation for understanding just about
everything the VGA can do, including the fabled Mode X and more. As you
read through these first chapters, please keep in mind that the *really*
exciting stuff—animation, 3-D, blurry-fast lines and circles and
polygons—has to wait until we have the fundamentals out of the way. So
hold on and follow along, and before you know it the fireworks will be
well underway.

We'll start our exploration with a quick overview of the VGA, and then
we'll dive right in and get a taste of what the VGA can do.

### The VGA

The VGA is the baseline adapter for modern IBM PC compatibles, present
in virtually every PC sold today or in the last several years. (Note
that the VGA is often nothing more than a chip on a motherboard, with
some memory, a DAC, and maybe a couple of glue chips; nonetheless, I'll
refer to it as an adapter from now on for simplicity.) It guarantees
that every PC is capable of documented resolutions up to 640x480 (with
16 possible colors per pixel) and 320x200 (with 256 colors per pixel),
as well as undocumented—but nonetheless thoroughly standard—resolutions
up to 360x480 in 256-color mode, as we'll see in Chapters 31-34 and
47-49. In order for a video adapter to claim VGA compatibility, it must
support all the features and code discussed in this book (with a very
few minor exceptions that I'll note)—and my experience is that just
about 100 percent of the video hardware currently shipping or shipped
since 1990 is in fact VGA compatible. Therefore, VGA code will run on
nearly all of the 50,000,000 or so PC compatibles out there, with the
exceptions being almost entirely obsolete machines from the 1980s. This
makes good VGA code and VGA programming expertise valuable commodities
indeed.

Right off the bat, I'd like to make one thing perfectly clear: The VGA
is hard—sometimes *very* hard—to program for good performance. Hard, but
not impossible—and that's why I like this odd board. It's a throwback to
an earlier generation of micros, when inventive coding and a solid
understanding of the hardware were the best tools for improving
performance. Increasingly, faster processors and powerful coprocessors
are seen as the solution to the sluggish software produced by high-level
languages and layers of interface and driver code, and that's surely a
valid approach. However, there are tens of millions of VGAs installed
right now, in machines ranging from 6-MHz 286s to 90-MHz Pentiums.
What's more, because the VGAs are generally 8- or at best 16-bit
devices, and because of display memory wait states, a faster processor
isn't as much of a help as you'd expect. The upshot is that only a
seasoned performance programmer who understands the VGA through and
through can drive the board to its fullest potential.

Throughout this book, I'll explore the VGA by selecting a specific
algorithm or feature and implementing code to support it on the VGA,
examining aspects of the VGA architecture as they become relevant.
You'll get to see VGA features in context, where they are more
comprehensible than in IBM's somewhat arcane documentation, and you'll
get working code to use or to modify to meet your needs.

The prime directive of VGA programming is that there's rarely just one
way to program the VGA for a given purpose. Once you understand the
tools the VGA provides, you'll be able to combine them to generate the
particular synergy your application needs. My VGA routines are not
intended to be taken as gospel, or to show "best" implementations, but
rather to start you down the road to understanding the VGA.

Let's begin.

### An Introduction to VGA Programming

Most discussions of the VGA start out with a traditional "Here's a block
diagram of the VGA" approach, with lists of registers and statistics.
I'll get to that eventually, but you can find it in IBM's VGA
documentation and several other books. Besides, it's numbing to read
specifications and explanations, and the VGA is an exciting adapter, the
kind that makes you want to get your hands dirty probing under the hood,
to write some nifty code just to see what the board can do. What's more,
the best way to understand the VGA is to see it work, so let's jump
right into a sample of the VGA in action, getting a feel for the VGA's
architecture in the process.

Listing 23.1 is a sample VGA program that pans around an animated
16-color medium-resolution (640x350) playfield. There's a lot packed
into this code; I'm going to focus on the VGA-specific aspects so we
don't get sidetracked. I'm not going to explain how the ball is
animated, for example; we'll get to animation starting in Chapter 42.
What I will do is cover each of the VGA features used in this
program—the virtual screen, vertical and horizontal panning, color plane
manipulation, multi-plane block copying, and page flipping—at a
conceptual level, letting the code itself demonstrate the implementation
details. We'll return to many of these concepts in more depth later in
this book.

### At the Core

A little background is necessary before we're ready to examine Listing
23.1. The VGA is built around four functional blocks, named the CRT
Controller (CRTC), the Sequence Controller (SC), the Attribute
Controller (AC), and the Graphics Controller (GC). The single-chip VGA
could have been designed to treat the registers for all the blocks as
one large set, addressed at one pair of I/O ports, but in the EGA, each
of these blocks was a separate chip, and the legacy of EGA compatibility
is why each of these blocks has a separate set of registers and is
addressed at different I/O ports in the VGA.

Each of these blocks has a sizable complement of registers. It is not
particularly important that you understand why a given block has a given
register; all the registers together make up the programming interface,
and it is the entire interface that is of interest to the VGA
programmer. However, the means by which most VGA registers are addressed
makes it necessary for you to remember which registers are in which
blocks.

Most VGA registers are addressed as *internally indexed* registers. The
internal address of the register is written to a given block's Index
register, and then the data for that register is written to the block's
Data register. For example, GC register 8, the Bit Mask register, is set
to 0FFH by writing 8 to port 3CEH, the GC Index register, and then
writing 0FFH to port 3CFH, the GC Data register. Internal indexing makes
it possible to address the 9 GC registers through only two ports, and
allows the entire VGA programming interface to be squeezed into fewer
than a dozen ports. The downside is that two I/O operations are required
to access most VGA registers.

The ports used to control the VGA are shown in Table 23.1. The CRTC, SC,
and GC Data registers are located at the addresses of their respective
Index registers plus one. However, the AC Index and Data registers are
located at the same address, 3C0H. The function of this port toggles on
every `OUT` to 3C0H, and resets to Index mode (in which the Index
register is programmed by the next `OUT` to 3C0H) on every read from
the Input Status 1 register (3DAH when the VGA is in a color mode,

| Register                                    | Address                  |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| AC Index/Data register                      | 3C0H (write with toggle) |

| Miscellaneous Output register               | 3C2H (write)             |
|                                             | 3CCH (read)              |
| Input Status 0 register                     | 3C2H (read)              |

| CRTC Index register                         | 3B4H/3D4H (read/write)   |
| CRTC Data register                          | 3B5H/3D5H (read/write)   |
| Input Status 1 register/AC Index/Data reset | 3 BAH/3DAH (read)        |
| Feature Control                             | 3BAH/3DAH (write)        |
|                                             | 3CAH (read)              |

Table: Table 1.1 The Ports through which the VGA is controlled.

3BAH in monochrome modes). Note that all CRTC registers are addressed at
either 3DXH or 3BXH, the former in color modes and the latter in
monochrome modes. This provides compatibility with the register
addressing of the now-vanished Color/Graphics Adapter and Monochrome
Display Adapter.

The method used in the VGA BIOS to set registers is to point DX to the
desired Index register, load AL with the index, perform a byte `OUT`,
increment DX to point to the Data register (except in the case of the
AC, where DX remains the same), load AL with the desired data, and
perform a byte `OUT`. A handy shortcut is to point DX to the desired
Index register, load AL with the index, load AH with the data, and
perform a word `OUT`. Since the high byte of the `OUT` value goes to
port DX+1, this is equivalent to the first method but is faster.
However, this technique does not work for programming the AC Index and
Data registers; both AC registers are addressed at 3C0H, so two separate
byte `OUT`s must be used to program the AC. (Actually, word `OUT`s
to the AC do work in the EGA, but not in the VGA, so they shouldn't be
used.) As mentioned above, you must be sure which mode—Index or Data—the
AC is in before you do an `OUT` to 3C0H; you can read the Input Status
1 register at any time to force the AC to Index mode.

How safe is the word-`OUT` method of addressing VGA registers? I have,
in the past, run into adapter/computer combinations that had trouble
with word `OUT`s; however, all such problems I am aware of have been
fixed. Moreover, a great deal of graphics software now uses word
`OUT`s, so any computer or VGA that doesn't properly support word
`OUT`s could scarcely be considered a clone at all.

#### Linear Planes and True VGA Modes

The VGA's memory is organized as four 64K planes. Each of these planes
is a linear bitmap; that is, each byte from a given plane controls eight
adjacent pixels on the screen, the next byte controls the next eight
pixels, and so on to the end of the scan line. The next byte then
controls the first eight pixels of the next scan line, and so on to the
end of the screen.

The VGA adds a powerful twist to linear addressing; the logical width of
the screen in VGA memory need not be the same as the physical width of
the display. The programmer is free to define all or part of the VGA's
large memory map as a logical screen of up to 4,080 pixels in width, and
then use the physical screen as a window onto any part of the logical
screen. What's more, a virtual screen can have any logical height up to
the capacity of VGA memory. Such a virtual screen could be used to store
a spreadsheet or a CAD/CAM drawing, for instance. As we will see
shortly, the VGA provides excellent hardware for moving around the
virtual screen; taken together, the virtual screen and the VGA's smooth
panning capabilities can generate very impressive effects.

All four linear planes are addressed in the same 64K memory space
starting at A000:0000. Consequently, there are four bytes at any given
address in VGA memory. The VGA provides special hardware to assist the
CPU in manipulating all four planes, in parallel, with a single memory
access, so that the programmer doesn't have to spend a great deal of
time switching between planes. Astute use of this VGA hardware allows
VGA software to as much as quadruple performance by processing the data
for all the planes in parallel.

Each memory plane provides one bit of data for each pixel. The bits for
a given pixel from each of the four planes are combined into a nibble
that serves as an address into the VGA's palette RAM, which maps the one
of 16 colors selected by display memory into any one of 64 colors, as
shown in Figure 23.1. All sixty-four mappings for all 16 colors are
independently programmable. (We'll discuss the VGA's color capabilities
in detail starting in Chapter 33.)

The VGA BIOS supports several graphics modes (modes 4, 5, and 6) in
which VGA memory appears not to be organized as four linear planes.
These modes exist for CGA compatibility only, and are not true VGA
graphics modes; use them when you need CGA-type operation and ignore
them the rest of the time. The VGA's special features are most powerful
in true VGA modes, and it is on the 16-color true-VGA modes (modes 0DH
(320x200), 0EH (640x200), 10H (640x350), and 12H (640x480)) that I will
concentrate in this part of the book. There is also a 256-color mode,
mode 13H, that appears to be a single linear plane, but, as we will see
in Chapters 31-34 and 47-49 of this book, that's a polite fiction—and
discarding that fiction gives us an opportunity to unleash the power of
the VGA's hardware for vastly better performance. VGA text modes, which
feature soft fonts, are another matter entirely, upon which we'll touch
from time to time.

With that background out of the way, we can get on to the sample VGA
program shown in Listing 23.1. I suggest you run the program before
continuing, since the explanations will mean far more to you if you've
seen the features in action.

#### Smooth Panning

The first thing you'll notice upon running the sample program is the
remarkable smoothness with which the display pans from side-to-side and
up-and-down. That the display can pan at all is made possible by two VGA
features: 256K of display memory and the virtual screen capability. Even
the most memory-hungry of the VGA modes, mode 12H (640x480), uses only
37.5K per plane, for a total of 150K out of the total 256K of VGA
memory. The medium-resolution mode, mode 10H (640x350), requires only
28K per plane, for a total of 112K. Consequently, there is room in VGA
memory to store more than two full screens of video data in mode 10H
(which the sample program uses), and there is room in all modes to store
a larger virtual screen than is actually displayed. In the sample
program, memory is organized as two virtual screens, each with a
resolution of 672x384, as shown in Figure 23.2. The area of the virtual
screen actually displayed at any given time is selected by setting the
display memory address at which to begin fetching video data; this is
set by way of the start address registers (Start Address High, CRTC
register 0CH, and Start Address Low, CRTC register 0DH). Together these
registers make up a 16-bit display memory address at which the CRTC
begins fetching data at the beginning of each video frame. Increasing
the start address causes higher-memory areas of the virtual screen to be
displayed. For example, the Start Address High register could be set to
80H and the Start Address Low register could be set to 00H in order to
cause the display screen to reflect memory starting at offset 8000H in
each plane, rather than at the default offset of 0.

![**Figure 23.2**  *Video memory organization for Listing 23.1.*](../images/23-02.jpg)

The logical height of the virtual screen is defined by the amount of VGA
memory available. As the VGA scans display memory for video data, it
progresses from the start address toward higher memory one scan line at
a time, until the frame is completed. Consequently, if the start address
is increased, lines farther toward the bottom of the virtual screen are
displayed; in effect, the virtual screen appears to scroll up on the
physical screen.

The logical width of the virtual screen is defined by the Offset
register (CRTC register 13H), which allows redefinition of the number of
words of display memory considered to make up one scan line. Normally,
40 words of display memory constitute a scan line; after the CRTC scans
these 40 words for 640 pixels worth of data, it advances 40 words from
the start of that scan line to find the start of the next scan line in
memory. This means that displayed scan lines are contiguous in memory.
However, the Offset register can be set so that scan lines are logically
wider (or narrower, for that matter) than their displayed width. The
sample program sets the Offset register to 2AH, making the logical width
of the virtual screen 42 words, or 42 \* 2 \* 8 = 672 pixels, as
contrasted with the actual width of the mode 10h screen, 40 words or 640
pixels. The logical height of the virtual screen in the sample program
is 384; this is accomplished simply by reserving 84 \* 384 contiguous
bytes of VGA memory for the virtual screen, where 84 is the virtual
screen width in bytes and 384 is the virtual screen height in scan
lines.

The start address is the key to panning around the virtual screen. The
start address registers select the row of the virtual screen that maps
to the top of the display; panning down a scan line requires only that
the start address be increased by the logical scan line width in bytes,
which is equal to the Offset register times two. The start address
registers select the column that maps to the left edge of the display as
well, allowing horizontal panning, although in this case only relatively
coarse byte-sized adjustments—panning by eight pixels at a time—are
supported.

Smooth horizontal panning is provided by the Horizontal Pel Panning
register, AC register 13H, working in conjunction with the start
address. Up to 7 pixels worth of single pixel panning of the displayed
image to the left is performed by increasing the Horizontal Pel Panning
register from 0 to 7. This exhausts the range of motion possible via the
Horizontal Pel Panning register; the next pixel's worth of smooth
panning is accomplished by incrementing the start address by one and
resetting the Horizontal Pel Panning register to 0. Smooth horizontal
panning should be viewed as a series of fine adjustments in the 8-pixel
range between coarse byte-sized adjustments.

A horizontal panning oddity: Alone among VGA modes, text mode (in most
cases) has 9 dots per character clock. Smooth panning in this mode
requires cycling the Horizontal Pel Panning register through the values
8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. 8 is the "no panning" setting.

There is one annoying quirk about programming the AC. When the AC Index
register is set, only the lower five bits are used as the internal
index. The next most significant bit, bit 5, controls the source of the
video data sent to the monitor by the VGA. When bit 5 is set to 1, the
output of the palette RAM, derived from display memory, controls the
displayed pixels; this is normal operation. When bit 5 is 0, video data
does not come from the palette RAM, and the screen becomes a solid
color. The only time bit 5 of the AC Index register should be 0 is
during the setting of a palette RAM register, since the CPU is only able
to write to palette RAM when bit 5 is 0. (Some VGAs do not enforce this,
but you should always set bit 5 to 0 before writing to the palette RAM
just to be safe.) Immediately after setting palette RAM, however, 20h
(or any other value with bit 5 set to 1) should be written to the AC
Index register to restore normal video, and at all other times bit 5
should be set to 1.

#### Color Plane Manipulation

The VGA provides a considerable amount of hardware assistance for
manipulating the four display memory planes. Two features illustrated by
the sample program are the ability to control which planes are written
to by a CPU write and the ability to copy four bytes—one from each
plane—with a single CPU read and a single CPU write.

The Map Mask register (SC register 2) selects which planes are written
to by CPU writes. If bit 0 of the Map Mask register is 1, then each byte
written by the CPU will be written to VGA memory plane 0, the plane that
provides the video data for the least significant bit of the palette RAM
address. If bit 0 of the Map Mask register is 0, then CPU writes will
not affect plane 0. Bits 1, 2, and 3 of the Map Mask register similarly
control CPU access to planes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Any of the 16
possible combinations of enabled and disabled planes can be selected.
Beware, however, of writing to an area of memory that is not zeroed.
Planes that are disabled by the Map Mask register are not altered by CPU
writes, so old and new images can mix on the screen, producing unwanted
color effects as, say, three planes from the old image mix with one
plane from the new image. The sample program solves this by ensuring
that the memory written to is zeroed. A better way to set all planes at
once is provided by the set/reset capabilities of the VGA, which I'll
cover in Chapter 25.

The sample program writes the image of the colored ball to VGA memory by
enabling one plane at a time and writing the image of the ball for that
plane. Each image is written to the same VGA addresses; only the
destination plane, selected by the Map Mask register, is different. You
might think of the ball's image as consisting of four colored overlays,
which together make up a multicolored image. The sample program writes a
blank image to VGA memory by enabling all planes and writing a block of
zero bytes; the zero bytes are written to all four VGA planes
simultaneously.

The images are written to a nondisplayed portion of VGA memory in order
to take advantage of a useful VGA hardware feature, the ability to copy
all four planes at once. As shown by the image-loading code discussed
above, four different sets of reads and writes—and several `OUT`s as
well—are required to copy a multicolored image into VGA memory as would
be needed to draw the same image into a non-planar pixel buffer. This
causes unacceptably slow performance, all the more so because the wait
states that occur on accesses to VGA memory make it very desirable to
minimize display memory accesses, and because `OUT`s tend to be very
slow.

The solution is to take advantage of the VGA's write mode 1, which is
selected via bits 0 and 1 of the GC Mode register (GC register 5). (Be
careful to preserve bits 2-7 when setting bits 0 and 1, as is done in
Listing 23.1.) In write mode 1, a single `CPU` read loads the
addressed byte from all four planes into the VGA's four internal
latches, and a single `CPU` write writes the contents of the latches
to the four planes. During the write, the byte written by the `CPU` is
irrelevant.

The sample program uses write mode 1 to copy the images that were
previously drawn to the high end of VGA memory into a desired area of
display memory, all in a single block copy operation. This is an
excellent way to keep the number of reads, writes, and OUTs required to
manipulate the VGA's display memory low enough to allow real-time
drawing.

The Map Mask register can still mask out planes in write mode 1. All
four planes are copied in the sample program because the Map Mask
register is still 0Fh from when the blank image was created.

The animated images appear to move a bit jerkily because they are
byte-aligned and so must move a minimum of 8 pixels horizontally. This
is easily solved by storing rotated versions of all images in VGA
memory, and then in each instance drawing the correct rotation for the
pixel alignment at which the image is to be drawn; we'll see this
technique in action in Chapter 49.

Don't worry if you're not catching everything in this chapter on the
first pass; the VGA is a complicated beast, and learning about it is an
iterative process. We'll be going over these features again, in
different contexts, over the course of the rest of this book.

#### Page Flipping

When animated graphics are drawn directly on the screen, with no
intermediate frame-composition stage, the image typically flickers
and/or ripples, an unavoidable result of modifying display memory at the
same time that it is being scanned for video data. The display memory of
the VGA makes it possible to perform page flipping, which eliminates
such problems. The basic premise of page flipping is that one area of
display memory is displayed while another is being modified. The
modifications never affect an area of memory as it is providing video
data, so no undesirable side effects occur. Once the modification is
complete, the modified buffer is selected for display, causing the
screen to change to the new image in a single frame's time, typically
1/60th or 1/70th of a second. The other buffer is then available for
modification.

As described above, the VGA has 64K per plane, enough to hold two pages
and more in 640x350 mode 10H, but not enough for two pages in 640x480
mode 12H. For page flipping, two non-overlapping areas of display memory
are needed. The sample program uses two 672x384 virtual pages, each
32,256 bytes long, one starting at A000:0000 and the other starting at
A000:7E00. Flipping between the pages is as simple as setting the start
address registers to point to one display area or the other—but, as it
turns out, that's not as simple as it sounds.

The timing of the switch between pages is critical to achieving
flicker-free animation. It is essential that the program never be
modifying an area of display memory as that memory is providing video
data. Achieving this is surprisingly complicated on the VGA, however.

The problem is as follows. The start address is latched by the VGA's
internal circuitry exactly once per frame, typically (but not always on
all clones) at the start of the vertical sync pulse. The vertical sync
status is, in fact, available as bit 3 of the Input Status 0 register,
addressable at 3BAH (in monochrome modes) or 3DAH (color).
Unfortunately, by the time the vertical sync status is observed by a
program, the start address for the next frame has already been latched,
having happened the instant the vertical sync pulse began. That means
that it's no good to wait for vertical sync to begin, then set the new
start address; if we did that, we'd have to wait until the *next*
vertical sync pulse to start drawing, because the page wouldn't flip
until then.

Clearly, what we want is to set the new start address, then wait for the
start of the vertical sync pulse, at which point we can be sure the page
has flipped. However, we can't just set the start address and wait,
because we might have the extreme misfortune to set one of the start
address registers before the start of vertical sync and the other after,
resulting in mismatched halves of the start address and a nasty jump of
the displayed image for one frame.

One possible solution to this problem is to pick a second page start
address that has a 0 value for the lower byte, so only the Start Address
High register ever needs to be set, but in the sample program in Listing
23.1 I've gone for generality and always set both bytes. To avoid
mismatched start address bytes, the sample program waits for pixel data
to be displayed, as indicated by the Display Enable status; this tells
us we're somewhere in the displayed portion of the frame, far enough
away from vertical sync so we can be sure the new start address will get
used at the next vertical sync. Once the Display Enable status is
observed, the program sets the new start address, waits for vertical
sync to happen, sets the new pel panning state, and then continues
drawing. Don't worry about the details right now; page flipping will
come up again, at considerably greater length, in later chapters.

Waiting for the sync pulse has the side effect of causing program
execution to synchronize to the VGA's frame rate of 60 or 70 frames per
second, depending on the display mode. This synchronization has the
useful consequence of causing the program to execute at the same speed
on any CPU that can draw fast enough to complete the drawing in a single
frame; the program just idles for the rest of each frame that it
finishes before the VGA is finished displaying the previous frame.

An important point illustrated by the sample program is that while the
VGA's display memory is far larger and more versatile than is the case
with earlier adapters, it is nonetheless a limited resource and must be
used judiciously. The sample program uses VGA memory to store two
672x384 virtual pages, leaving only 1024 bytes free to store images. In
this case, the only images needed are a colored ball and a blank block
with which to erase it, so there is no problem, but many applications
require dozens or hundreds of images. The tradeoffs between virtual page
size, page flipping, and image storage must always be kept in mind when
designing programs for the VGA.

To see the program run in 640x200 16-color mode, comment out the `EQU`
line for `MEDRES_VIDEO_MODE`.

### The Hazards of VGA Clones

Earlier, I said that any VGA that doesn't support the features and
functionality covered in this book can't properly be called VGA
compatible. I also noted that there are some exceptions, however, and
we've just come to the most prominent one. You see, all VGAs really
*are* compatible with the IBM VGA's functionality when it comes to
drawing pixels into display memory; all the write modes and read modes
and set/reset capabilities and everything else involved with
manipulating display memory really does work in the same way on all VGAs
and VGA clones. That compatibility isn't as airtight when it comes to
scanning pixels out of display memory and onto the screen in certain
infrequently-used ways, however.

The areas of incompatibility of which I'm aware are illustrated by the
sample program, and may in fact have caused you to see some glitches
when you ran Listing 23.1. The problem, which arises only on certain
VGAs, is that some settings of the Row Offset register cause some pixels
to be dropped or displaced to the wrong place on the screen; often, this
happens only in conjunction with certain start address settings. (In my
experience, only VRAM (Video RAM)-based VGAs exhibit this problem, no
doubt due to the way that pixel data is fetched from VRAM in large
blocks.) Panning and large virtual bitmaps can be made to work reliably,
by careful selection of virtual bitmap sizes and start addresses, but
it's difficult; that's one of the reasons that most commercial software
does not use these features, although a number of games do. The upshot
is that if you're going to use oversized virtual bitmaps and pan around
them, you should take great care to test your software on a wide variety
of VRAM- and DRAM-based VGAs.

### Just the Beginning

That pretty well covers the important points of the sample VGA program
in Listing 23.1. There are many VGA features we didn't even touch on,
but the object was to give you a feel for the variety of features
available on the VGA, to convey the flexibility and complexity of the
VGA's resources, and in general to give you an initial sense of what VGA
programming is like. Starting with the next chapter, we'll begin to
explore the VGA systematically, on a more detailed basis.

### The Macro Assembler

The code in this book is written in both C and assembly. I think C is a
good development environment, but I believe that often the best code
(although not necessarily the easiest to write or the most reliable) is
written in assembly. This is especially true of graphics code for the
x86 family, given segments, the string instructions, and the asymmetric
and limited register set, and for real-time programming of a complex
board like the VGA, there's really no other choice for the lowest-level
code.

Before I'm deluged with protests from C devotees, let me add that the
majority of my productive work is done in C; no programmer is immune to
the laws of time, and C is simply a more time-efficient environment in
which to develop, particularly when working in a programming team. In
this book, however, we're after the *sine qua non* of PC
graphics—performance—and we can't get there from here without a fair
amount of assembly language.

Now that we know what the VGA looks like in broad strokes and have a
sense of what VGA programming is like, we can start looking at specific
areas in depth. In the next chapter, we'll take a look at the hardware
assistance the VGA provides the CPU during display memory access. There
are four latches and four ALUs in those chips, along with some useful
masks and comparators, and it's that hardware that's the difference
between sluggish performance and making the VGA get up and dance.
