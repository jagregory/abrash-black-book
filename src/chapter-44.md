## Chapter 44 -- Split Screens Save the Page Flipped Day

### 640x480 Page Flipped Animation in 64K...Almost

Almost doesn't count, they say—at least in horseshoes and maybe a few
other things. This is especially true in digital circles, where if you
need 12 MB of hard disk to install something and you only have 10 MB
left (a situation that seems to be some sort of eternal law) you're
stuck.

And that's only infuriating until you dredge up the gumption to go in
there and free up some space. How would you feel if you were up against
an "almost-but-not-quite" kind of a wall that couldn't be breached by
freeing up something elsewhere? Suppose you were within a few KB of
implementing a wonderful VGA animation scheme that provided lots of
screen space, square pixels, smooth motion and more than adequate
speed—but all the memory you have is all there is? What would you do?

Scream a little. Or throw something that won't break easily. Then you
sit down and let your right brain do what it was designed to do. Sure
enough, there's a way, and in this chapter I'll explain how a little VGA
secret called *page splitting* can save the day for page flipped
animation in 640x480 mode. But to do that, I have to lay a little
groundwork first. Or maybe a lot of groundwork.

No horseshoes here.

#### A Plethora of Challenges

In its simplest terms, computer animation consists of rapidly redrawing
similar images at slightly differing locations, so that the eye
interprets the successive images as a single object in motion over time.
The fact that the world is an analog realm and the images displayed on a
computer screen consist of discrete pixels updated at a maximum rate of
about 70 Hz is irrelevant; your eye can interpret both real-world images
and pixel patterns on the screen as objects in motion, and that's that.

One of the key problems of computer animation is that it takes time to
redraw a screen, time during which the bitmap controlling the screen is
in an intermediate state, with, quite possibly, many objects erased and
others half-drawn. Even when only briefly displayed, a partially-updated
screen can cause flicker at best, and at worst can destroy the illusion
of motion entirely.

Another problem of animation is that the screen must update often enough
so that motion appears continuous. A moving object that moves just once
every second, shifting by hundreds of pixels each time it does move,
will appear to jump, not to move smoothly. Therefore, there are two
overriding requirements for smooth animation: 1) the bitmap must be
updated quickly (once per frame—60 to 70 Hz—is ideal, although 30 Hz
will do fine), and, 2) the process of redrawing the screen must be
invisible to the user; only the end result should ever be seen. Both of
these requirements are met by the program presented in Listings 44.1 and
44.2.

#### A Page Flipping Animation Demonstration

The listings taken together form a sample animation program, in which a
single object bounces endlessly off other objects, with instructions and
a count of bounces displayed at the bottom of the screen. I'll discuss
various aspects of Listings 44.1 and 44.2 during the balance of this
article. The listings are too complex and involve too much VGA and
animation knowledge for for me to discuss it all in exhaustive detail
(and I've covered a lot of this stuff earlier in the book); instead,
I'll cover the major elements, leaving it to you to explore the finer
points—and, hope, to experiment with and expand on the code I'll
provide.

Listing 44.1 is written in C. It could equally well have been written in
assembly language, and would then have been somewhat faster. However,
wanted to make the point (as I've made again and again) that assembly
language, and, indeed, optimization in general, is needed only in the
most critical portions of any program, and then only when the program
would otherwise be too slow. Only in a highly performance-sensitive
situation would the performance boost resulting from converting Listing
44.1 to assembly justify the time spent in coding and the bugs that
would likely creep in—and the sample program already updates the screen
at the maximum possible rate of once per frame even on a 1985-vintage
8-MHz AT. In this case, faster performance would result only in a longer
wait for the page to flip.

#### Write Mode 3

It's possible to update the bitmap very efficiently on the VGA, because
the VGA can draw up to 8 pixels at once, and because the VGA provides a
number of hardware features to speed up drawing. This article makes
considerable use of one particularly unusual hardware feature, write
mode 3. We discussed write mode 3 back in Chapter 26, but we've covered
a lot of ground since then—so I'm going to run through a quick refresher
on write mode 3.

Some background: In the standard VGA's high-resolution mode, mode 12H
(640x480 with 16 colors, the mode in which this chapter's sample program
runs), each byte of display memory controls 8 adjacent pixels on the
screen. (The color of each pixel is, in turn, controlled by 4 bits
spread across the four VGA memory planes, but we need not concern
ourselves with that here.) Now, there will often be times when we want
to change some but not all of the pixels controlled by a particular byte
of display memory. This is not easily done, for there is no way to write
half a byte, or two bits, or such to memory; it's the whole byte or none
of it at all.

You might think that using AND and OR to manipulate individual bits
could solve the problem. Alas, not so. ANDing and ORing would work if
the VGA had only one plane of memory (like the original monochrome
Hercules Graphics Adapter) but the VGA has four planes, and ANDing and
ORing would work only if we selected and manipulated each plane
separately, a process that would be hideously slow. No, with the VGA you
must use the hardware assist features, or you might as well forget about
real-time screen updates altogether. Write mode 3 will do the trick for
our present needs.

Write mode 3 is useful when you want to set some but not all of the
pixels in a single byte of display memory *to the same color.* That is,
if you want to draw a number of pixels within a byte in a single color,
write mode 3 is a good way to do it.

Write mode 3 works like this. First, set the Graphics Controller Mode
register to write mode 3. (Look at Listing 44.2 for code that does
everything described here.) Next, set the Set/Reset register to the
color with which you wish to draw, in the range 0-15. (It is not
necessary to explicitly enable set/reset via the Enable Set/Reset
register; write mode 3 does that automatically.) Then, to draw
individual pixels within a single byte, simply read display memory, and
then write a byte to display memory with 1-bits where you want the color
to be drawn and 0-bits where you want the current bitmap contents to be
preserved. (Note well that *the data actually read by the CPU doesn't
matter;* the read operation latches all four planes' data, as described
way back in Chapter 24.) So, for example, if write mode 3 is enabled and
the Set/Reset register is set to 1 (blue), then the following sequence
of operations:

```nasm
mov   dx,0a000h
mov   es,dx
mov   al,es:[0]
mov   byte ptr es:[0],0f0h
```

will change the first 4 pixels on the screen (the left nibble of the
byte at offset 0 in display memory) to blue, and will leave the next 4
pixels (the right nibble of the byte at offset 0) unchanged.

Using one `MOV` to read from display memory and another to write to
display memory is not particularly efficient on some processors. In
Listing 44.2, I instead use `XCHG`, which reads and then writes a
memory location in a single operation, as in:

```nasm
mov    dx,0a000h
mov    es,dx
mov    al,0f0h
xchg   es:[0],al
```

Again, the actual value that's read is irrelevant. In general, the
`XCHG` approach is more compact than two `MOV`s, and is faster on
386 and earlier processors, but slower on 486s and Pentiums.

If all pixels in a byte of display memory are to be drawn in a single
color, it's not necessary to read before writing, because none of the
information in display memory at that byte needs to be preserved; a
simple write of 0FFH (to draw all bits) will set all 8 pixels to the
set/reset color:

```nasm
mov   dx,0a000h
mov   es,dx
mov   byte ptr es:[di],0ffh
```

In short, write mode 3 is a good choice for single-color drawing that
modifies individual pixels within display memory bytes. Not
coincidentally, the sample application draws only single-color objects
within the animation area; this allows write mode 3 to be used for all
drawing, in keeping with our desire for speedy screen updates.

#### Drawing Text

We'll need text in the sample application; is that also a good use for
write mode 3? Sometimes it is, but not in this particular case.

Each character in a font is represented by a pattern of bits, with
1-bits representing character pixels and 0-bits representing background
pixels. Since we'll be using the 8x8 font stored in the BIOS ROM (a
pointer to which can be obtained by calling a BIOS service, as
illustrated by Listing 44.2), each character is exactly 8 bits, or 1
byte wide. We'll further insist that characters be placed on byte
boundaries (that is, with their left edges only at pixels with X
coordinates that are multiples of 8); this means that the character
bytes in the font are automatically aligned with display memory, and no
rotation or clipping of characters is needed. Finally, we'll draw all
text in white.

Given the above assumptions, drawing text is easy; we simply copy each
byte of each character to the appropriate location in display memory,
and *voila*, we're done. Text copying is done in write mode 0, in which
the byte written to display memory is copied to all four planes at once;
hence, 1-bits turn into white (color value 0FH, with 1-bits in all four
planes), and 0-bits turn into black (color value 0). This is faster than
using write mode 3 because write mode 3 requires a read/write of display
memory (or at least preloading the latches with the background color),
while the write mode 0 approach requires only a write to display memory.

I'm not going to delve any deeper into the considerable issues of
drawing VGA text; I just want to sensitize you to the existence of
approaches other than the ones used in Listings 44.1 and 44.2. On the
VGA, the rule is: If there's something you want to do, there probably
are 10 ways to do it, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Your
mission, should you decide to accept it, is to figure out which one is
best for your particular application.

#### Page Flipping

Now that we know how to update the screen reasonably quickly, it's time
to get on to the fun stuff. Page flipping answers the second requirement
for animation, by keeping bitmap changes off the screen until they're
complete. In other words, page flipping guarantees that partially
updated bitmaps are never seen.

How is it possible to update a bitmap without seeing the changes as
they're made? Easy—with page flipping, there are *two* bitmaps; the
program shows you one bitmap while it updates the other. Conceptually,
it's that simple. In practice, unfortunately, it's not so simple,
because of the design of the VGA. To understand why that is, we must
look at how the VGA turns bytes in display memory into pixels on the
screen.

The VGA bitmap is a linear 64 K block of memory. (True, most adapters
nowadays are SuperVGAs with more than 256 K of display memory, but every
make of SuperVGA has its own way of letting you access that extra
memory, so going beyond standard VGA is a daunting and difficult task.
Also, it's hard to manipulate the large frame buffers of SuperVGA modes
fast enough for real-time animation.) Normally, the VGA picks up the
first byte of memory (the byte at offset 0) and displays the
corresponding 8 pixels on the screen, then picks up the byte at offset 1
and displays the next 8 pixels, and so on to the end of the screen.
However, the offset of the first byte of display memory picked up during
each frame is not fixed at 0, but is rather programmable by way of the
Start Address High and Low registers, which together store the 16-bit
offset in display memory at which the bitmap to be displayed during the
next frame starts. So, for example, in mode 10H (640x350, 16 colors), a
large enough bitmap to store a complete screen of information can be
stored at display memory offsets 0 through 27,999, and *another* full
bitmap could be stored at offsets 28,000 through 55,999, as shown in
Figure 44.1. (I'm discussing 640x350 mode at the moment for good reason;
we'll get to 640x480 shortly.) When the Start Address registers are set
to 0, the first bitmap (or page) is displayed; when they are set to
28,000, the second bitmap is displayed. Page flipped animation can be
performed by displaying page 0 and drawing to page 1, then setting the
start address to page 1 to display that page and drawing to page 0, and
so on *ad infinitum.*

#### Knowing When to Flip

There's a hitch, though, and that hitch is knowing exactly when it is
that the page has flipped. The page doesn't flip the instant that you
set the Start Address registers. The VGA loads the starting offset from
the Start Address registers once before starting each frame, then pays
those registers no nevermind until the next frame comes around. This
means that you can set the Start Address registers whenever you want—but
the page actually being displayed doesn't change until after the VGA
loads that new offset in preparation for the next frame.

The potential problem should be obvious. Suppose that page 1 is being
displayed, and you're updating page 0. You finish drawing to page 0, set
the Start Address registers to 0 to switch to displaying page 0, and
start updating page 1, which is no longer displayed. Or is it? If the
VGA was in the middle of the current frame, displaying page 1, when you
set the Start Address registers, then page 1 is going to be displayed
for the rest of the frame, no matter what you do with the Start Address
registers. If you start updating page 1 right away, any changes you make
may well show up on the screen, because page 0 hasn't yet flipped to
being displayed in place of page 1—and that defeats the whole purpose of
page flipping.

To avoid this problem, it is mandatory that you wait until you're sure
the page has flipped. The Start Address registers are, according to my
tests, loaded at the start of the Vertical Sync signal, although that
may not be the case with all VGA clones. The Vertical Sync status is
provided as bit 3 of the Input Status 1 register, so it would seem that
all you need to do to flip a page is set the new Start Address
registers, wait for the start of the Vertical Sync pulse that indicates
that the page has flipped, and be on your merry way.

Almost—but not quite. (Do I hear teeth gnashing in the background?) The
problem is this: Suppose that, by coincidence, you set one of the Start
Address registers just before the start of Vertical Sync, and the other
right after the start of Vertical Sync. Why, then, for one frame the
Start Address High value for one page would be mixed with the Start
Address Low value for the other page, and, depending on the start
address values, the whole screen could appear to shift any number of
pixels for a single, horrible frame. *This must never happen!* The
solution is to set the Start Address registers when you're certain
Vertical Sync is not about to start. The easiest way to know that is to
check for the Display Enable status (bit 0 of the Input Status 1
register) being active; that means that bitmap-controlled pixels are
being scanned onto the screen, and, since Vertical Sync happens in the
middle of the vertical non-display portion of the frame, Vertical Sync
can never be anywhere nearby if Display Enable is active. (Note that one
good alternative is to set up both pages with a start address that's a
multiple of 256, and just change the Start Address High register and
wait for Vertical Sync, with no Display Enable wait required.)

So, to flip pages, you must complete all drawing to the non-displayed
page, wait for Display Enable to be active, set the new start address,
and wait for Vertical Sync to be active. At that point, you can be fully
confident that the page that you just flipped off the screen is not
displayed and can safely (invisibly) be updated. A side benefit of page
flipping is that your program will automatically have a constant time
base, with the rate at which new screens are drawn synchronized to the
frame rate of the display (typically 60 or 70 Hz). However, complex
updates may take more than one frame to complete, especially on slower
processors; this can be compensated for by maintaining a count of new
screens drawn and cross-referencing that to the BIOS timer count
periodically, accelerating the overall pace of the animation (moving
farther each time and the like) if updates are happening too slowly.

#### Enter the Split Screen

So far, I've discussed page flipping in 640x350 mode. There's a reason
for that: 640x350 is the highest-resolution standard mode in which
there's enough display memory for two full pages on a standard VGA. It's
possible to program the VGA to a non-standard 640x400 mode and still
have two full pages, but that's pretty much the limit. One 640x480 page
takes 38,400 bytes of display memory, and clearly there isn't enough
room in 64 K of display memory for two of *those* monster pages.

And yet, 640x480 is a wonderful mode in many ways. It offers a 1:1
aspect ratio (square pixels), and it provides by far the best resolution
of any 16-color mode. Surely there's *some* way to bring the visual
appeal of page flipping to this mode?

Surely there is—but it's an odd solution indeed. The VGA has a feature,
known as the *split screen,* that allows you to force the offset from
which the VGA fetches video data back to 0 after any desired scan line.
For example, you can program the VGA to scan through display memory as
usual until it finishes scan line number 338, and then get the first
byte of information for scan line number 339 from offset 0 in display
memory.

That, in turn, allows us to divvy up display memory into three areas, as
shown in Figure 44.2. The area from 0 to 11,279 is reserved for the
split screen, the area from 11,280 to 38,399 is used for page 0, and the
area from 38,400 to 65,519 is used for page 1. This allows page flipping
to be performed in the top 339 scan lines (about 70 percent) of the
screen, and leaves the bottom 141 scan lines for non-animation purposes,
such as showing scores, instructions, statuses, and suchlike. (Note that
the allocation of display memory and number of scan lines are dictated
by the desire to have as many page-flipped scan lines as possible; you
may, if you wish, have fewer page-flipped lines and reserve part of the
bitmap for other uses, such as off-screen storage for images.)

![**Figure 44.2**  *Memory allocation for mode 12h page flipping.*](../images/44-02.jpg)

The sample program for this chapter uses the split screen and page
flipping exactly as described above. The playfield through which the
object bounces is the page-flipped portion of the screen, and the
rectangle at the bottom containing the bounce count and the instructions
is the split (that is, not animatable) portion of the screen. Of course,
to the user it all looks like one screen. There are no visible
boundaries between the two unless you choose to create them.

Very few animation applications use the entire screen for animation. If
you can get by with 339 scan lines of animation, split-screen page
flipping gives you the best combination of square pixels and high
resolution possible on a standard VGA.

So. Is VGA animation worth all the fuss? *Mais oui.* Run the sample
program; if you've never seen aggressive VGA animation before, you'll be
amazed at how smooth it can be. Not every square millimeter of every
animated screen must be in constant motion. Most graphics screens need a
little quiet space to display scores, coordinates, file names, or (if
all else fails) company logos. If you don't tell the user he's/she's
only getting 339 scan lines of animation, he'll/she'll probably never
know.
