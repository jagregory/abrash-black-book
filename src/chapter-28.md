## Chapter 28 -- Reading VGA Memory

### Read Modes 0 and 1, and the Color Don't Care Register

Well, it's taken five chapters, but we've finally covered the data write
path and all four write modes of the VGA. Now it's time to tackle the
VGA's two read modes. While the read modes aren't as complex as the
write modes, they're nothing to sneeze at. In particular, read mode 1
(also known as color compare mode) is rather unusual and not at all
intuitive.

You may well ask, isn't *anything* about programming the VGA
straightforward? Well...no. But then, clearing up the mysteries of VGA
programming is what this part of the book is all about, so let's get
started.

### Read Mode 0

Read mode 0 is actually relatively uncomplicated, given that you
understand the four-plane nature of the VGA. (If you don't understand
the four-plane nature of the VGA, I strongly urge you to read Chapters
23-27 before continuing with this chapter.) Read mode 0, the read mode
counterpart of write mode 0, lets you read from one (and only one) plane
of VGA memory at any one time.

Read mode 0 is selected by setting bit 3 of the Graphics Mode register
(Graphics Controller register 5) to 0. When read mode 0 is active, the
plane that supplies the data when the CPU reads VGA memory is the plane
selected by bits 1 and 0 of the Read Map register (Graphics Controller
register 4). When the Read Map register is set to 0, CPU reads come from
plane 0 (the plane that normally contains blue pixel data). When the
Read Map register is set to 1, CPU reads come from plane 1; when the
Read Map register is 2, CPU reads come from plane 2; and when the Read
Map register is 3, CPU reads come from plane 3.

That all seems simple enough; in read mode 0, the Read Map register acts
as a selector among the four planes, determining which one of the planes
will supply the value returned to the CPU. There is a slight
complication, however, in that the value written to the Read Map
register in order to read from a given plane is not the same as the
value written to the Map Mask register (Sequence Controller register 2)
in order to write to that plane.

Why is that? Well, in read mode 0, one and only one plane can be read at
a time, so there are only four possible settings of the Read Map
register: 0, 1, 2, or 3, to select reads from plane 0, 1, 2, or 3. In
write mode 0, by contrast (in fact, in any write mode), any or all
planes may be written to at once, since the byte written by the CPU can
"fan out" to multiple planes. Consequently, there are not four but
sixteen possible settings of the Map Mask register. The setting of the
Map Mask register to write only to plane 0 is 1; to write only to plane
1 is 2; to write only to plane 2 is 4; and to write only to plane 3 is
8.

As you can see, the settings of the Read Map and Map Mask registers for
accessing a given plane don't match. The code in Listing 28.1
illustrates this. Listing 28.1 simply copies a sixteen-color image from
system memory to VGA memory, one plane at a time, then animates by
repeatedly copying the image back to system memory, again one plane at a
time, clearing the old image, and copying the image to a new location in
VGA memory. Note the differing settings of the Read Map and Map Mask
registers.

By the way, the code in Listing 28.1 is intended only to illustrate read
mode 0, and is, in general, a poor way to perform animation, since it's
slow and tends to flicker. Later in this book, we'll take a look at some
far better VGA animation techniques.

As you'd expect, neither the read mode nor the setting of the Read Map
register affects CPU *writes* to VGA memory in any way.

### Read Mode 1

Read mode 0 is the workhorse read mode, but it's got an annoying
limitation: Whenever you want to determine the color of a given pixel in
read mode 0, you have to perform four VGA memory reads, one for each
plane, and then interpret the four bytes you've read as eight 16-color
pixels. That's a lot of programming. The code is also likely to run
slowly, all the more so because a standard IBM VGA takes an average of
1.1 microseconds to complete each memory read, and read mode 0 requires
four reads in order to read the four planes, not to mention the even
greater amount of time taken by the `OUT`s required to switch between
the planes. (1.1 microseconds may not sound like much, but on a 66-MHz
486, it's 73 clock cycles! Local-bus VGAs can be a good deal faster, but
a read from the fastest local-bus adapter I've yet seen would still cost
in the neighborhood of 10 486/66 cycles.)

Read mode 1, also known as *color compare mode*, provides special
hardware assistance for determining whether a pixel is a given color.
With a single read mode 1 read, you can determine whether each of up to
eight pixels is a specific color, and you can even specify any or all
planes as "don't care" planes in the pixel color comparison.

Read mode 1 is selected by setting bit 3 of the Graphics Mode register
(Graphics Controller register 5) to 1. In its simplest form, read mode 1
compares the cross-plane value of each of the eight pixels at a given
address to the color value in bits 3-0 of the Color Compare register
(Graphics Controller register 2), and returns a 1 to the CPU in the bit
position of each pixel that matches the color in the Color Compare
register and a 0 for each pixel that does not match.

That's certainly interesting, but what's read mode 1 good for? One
obvious application is in implementing flood-fill algorithms, since read
mode 1 makes it easy to tell when a given byte contains a pixel of a
boundary color. Another application is in detecting on-screen object
collisions, as illustrated by the code in Listing 28.2.

### When all Planes "Don't Care"

Still and all, there aren't all that many uses for basic color compare
operations. There is, however, a genuinely odd application of read mode
1 that's worth knowing about; but in order to understand that, we must
first look at the "don't care" aspect of color compare operation.

As described earlier, during read mode 1 reads the color stored in the
Color Compare register is compared to each of the 8 pixels at a given
address in VGA memory. But—and it's a big but—any plane for which the
corresponding bit in the Color Don't Care register is a 0 is always
considered a color compare match, regardless of the values of that
plane's bits in the pixels and in the Color Compare register.

Let's look at this another way. A given pixel is controlled by four
bits, one in each plane. Normally (when the Color Don't Care register is
0FH), the color in the Color Compare register is compared to the four
bits of each pixel; bit 0 of the Color Compare register is compared to
the plane 0 bit of each pixel, bit 1 of the Color Compare register is
compared to the plane 1 bit of each pixel, and so on. That is, when the
lower four bits of the Color Don't Care register are all set to 1, then
all four bits of a given pixel must match the Color Compare register in
order for a read mode 1 read to return a 1 for that pixel to the CPU.

However, if any bit of the Color Don't Care register is 0, then the
corresponding bit of each pixel is unconditionally considered to match
the corresponding bit of the Color Compare register. You might think of
the Color Don't Care register as selecting exactly which planes should
matter in a given read mode 1 read. At the extreme, if all bits of the
Color Don't Care register are 0, then read mode 1 reads will always
return 0FFH, since all planes are considered to match all bits of all
pixels.

Now, we're all prone to using tools the "right" way—that is, in the way
in which they were intended to be used. By that token, the Color Don't
Care register is clearly intended to mask one or more planes out of a
color comparison, and as such, has limited use. However, the Color Don't
Care register becomes far more interesting in exactly the "extreme" case
described above, where all planes become "don't care" planes.

Why? Well, as I've said, when all planes are "don't care" planes, read
mode 1 reads always return 0FFH. Now, when you AND any value with 0FFH,
the value remains unchanged, and that can be awfully handy when you're
using the bit mask to modify selected pixels in VGA memory. Recall that
you must always read VGA memory to load the latches before writing to
VGA memory when you're using the bit mask. Traditionally, two separate
instructions—a read followed by a write—are used to perform this task.
The code in Listing 28.2 uses this approach. Suppose, however, that
you've set the VGA to read mode 1, with the Color Don't Care register
set to 0 (meaning all reads of VGA memory will return 0FFH). Under these
circumstances, you can use a single `AND` instruction to both read and
write VGA memory, since ANDing any value with 0FFH leaves that value
unchanged.

Listing 28.3 illustrates an efficient use of write mode 3 in conjunction
with read mode 1 and a Color Don't Care register setting of 0. The mask
in AL is passed directly to the VGA's bit mask (that's how write mode 3
works—see Chapter 4 for details). Because the VGA always returns 0FFH,
the single `AND` instruction loads the latches, and writes the value
in AL, unmodified, to the VGA, where it is used to generate the bit
mask. This is more compact and register-efficient than using separate
instructions to read and write, although it is not necessarily faster by
cycle count, because on a 486 or a Pentium `MOV` is a 1-cycle
instruction, but `AND` with memory is a 3-cycle instruction. However,
given display memory wait states, it is often the case that the two
approaches run at the same speed, and the register that the above
approach frees up can frequently be used to save one or more cycles in
any case.

By the way, Listing 28.3 illustrates how write mode 3 can make for
excellent pixel- and line-drawing code.

I hope I've given you a good feel for what color compare mode is and
what it might be used for. Color compare mode isn't particularly easy to
understand, but it's not that complicated in actual operation, and it's
certainly useful at times; take some time to study the sample code and
perform a few experiments of your own, and you may well find useful
applications for color compare mode in your graphics code.

A final note: The Read Map register has no effect in read mode 1, and
the Color Compare and Color Don't Care registers have no effect either
in read mode 0 or when writing to VGA memory. And with that, by gosh,
we're actually done with the basics of accessing VGA memory!

Not to worry—that still leaves us a slew of interesting VGA topics,
including smooth panning and scrolling, the split screen, color
selection, page flipping, and Mode X. And that's not to mention actual
uses to which the VGA's hardware can be put, including lines, circles,
polygons, and my personal favorite, animation. We've covered a lot of
challenging and rewarding ground—and we've only just begun.
