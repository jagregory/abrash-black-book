## Chapter 53 -- Raw Speed and More

### The Naked Truth About Speed in 3-D Animation

Years ago, this friend of mine—let's call him Bert—went to Hawaii with
three other fellows to celebrate their graduation from high school. This
was an unchaperoned trip, and they behaved pretty much as responsibly as
you'd expect four teenagers to behave, which is to say, not; there's a
story about a rental car that, to this day, Bert can't bring himself to
tell. They had a good time, though, save for one thing: no girls.

By and by, they met a group of girls by the pool, but the boys couldn't
get past the hi-howya-doin stage, so they retired to their hotel room to
plot a better approach. This being the early '70s, and them being
slightly tipsy teenagers with raging hormones and the effective combined
IQ of four eggplants, it took them no time at all to come up with a
brilliant plan: streaking. The girls had mentioned their room number, so
the boys piled into the elevator, pushed the button for the girls'
floor, shucked their clothes as fast as they could, and sprinted to the
girls' door. They knocked on the door and ran on down the hall. As the
girls opened their door, Bert and his crew raced past, toward the
elevator, laughing hysterically.

Bert was by far the fastest of them all. He whisked between the elevator
doors just as they started to close; by the time his friends got there,
it was too late, and the doors slid shut in their faces. As the elevator
began to move, Bert could hear the frantic pounding of six fists
thudding on the closed doors. As Bert stood among the clothes littering
the elevator floor, the thought of his friends stuck in the hall, naked
as jaybirds, was just too much, and he doubled over with helpless
laughter, tears streaming down his face. The universe had blessed him
with one of those exceedingly rare moments of perfect timing and
execution.

The universe wasn't done with Bert quite yet, though. He was still
contorted with laughter—and still quite thoroughly undressed—when the
elevator doors opened again. On the lobby.

And with that, we come to this chapter's topics: raw speed and hidden
surfaces.

### Raw Speed, Part 1: Assembly Language

I would like to state, here and for the record, that I am not an
assembly language fanatic. Frankly, I prefer programming in C; assembly
language is hard work, and I can get a whole lot more done with fewer
hassles in C. However, I *am* a performance fanatic, performance being
defined as having programs be as nimble as possible in those areas where
the user wants fast response. And, in the course of pursuing
performance, there are times when a little assembly language goes a long
way.

We're now four chapters into development of the X-Sharp 3-D animation
package. In realtime animation, performance is *sine qua non* (Latin for
"Make it fast or find another line of work"), so some judiciously
applied assembly language is in order. In the previous chapter, we got
up to a serviceable performance level by switching to fixed-point math,
then implementing the fixed-point multiplication and division functions
in assembly in order to take advantage of the 386's 32-bit capabilities.
There's another area of the program that fairly cries out for assembly
language: matrix math. The function to multiply a matrix by a vector
(`XformVec()`) and the function to concatenate matrices
(`ConcatXforms()`) both loop heavily around calls to **FixedMul();** a
lot of calling and looping can be eliminated by converting these
functions to pure assembly language.

Listing 53.1 is the module FIXED.ASM from this chapter's iteration of
X-Sharp, with `XformVec()` and `ConcatXforms()` implemented in
assembly language. The code is heavily optimized, to the extent of
completely unrolling the loops via macros so that looping is eliminated
altogether. FIXED.ASM is highly effective; the time taken for matrix
math is now down to the point where it's a fairly minor component of
execution time, representing less than ten percent of the total. It's
time to turn our optimization sights elsewhere.

### Raw Speed, Part II: Look it Up

It's a funny thing about Turbo Profiler: Time spent in the Borland C++
80x87 emulator doesn't show up directly anywhere that I can see in the
timing results. The only way to detect it is by way of the line that
reports what percent of total time is represented by all the areas that
were profiled; if you're profiling all areas, whatever's not explicitly
accounted for seems to be the floating-point emulator time. This quirk
fooled me for a while, leading me to think sine and cosine weren't major
drags on performance, because the `sin()` and `cos()` functions
spend most of their time in the emulator, and that time doesn't show up
in Turbo Profiler's statistics on those functions. Once I figured out
what was going on, it turned out that not only were `sin()` and
`cos()` major drags, they were taking up over half the total execution
time by themselves.

The solution is a lookup table. Listing 53.1 contains a function called
`CosSin()` that calculates both the sine and cosine of an angle, via a
lookup table. The function accepts angles in tenths of degrees; I
decided to use tenths of degrees rather than radians because that way
it's always possible to look up the sine and cosine of the exact angle
requested, rather than approximating, as would be required with radians.
Tenths of degrees should be fine enough control for most purposes; if
not, it's easy to alter `CosSin()` for finer gradations yet. GENCOS.C,
the program used to generate the lookup table (COSTABLE.INC), included
in Listing 53.1, can be found in the XSHARP22 subdirectory on the
listings diskette. GENCOS.C can generate a cosine table with any
integral number of steps per degree.

FIXED.ASM (Listing 53.1) speeds X-Sharp up quite a bit, and it changes
the performance balance a great deal. When we started out with 3-D
animation, calculation time was the dragon we faced; more than 90
percent of the total time was spent doing matrix and projection math.
Additional optimizations in the area of math could still be made (using
32-bit multiplies in the backface-removal code, for example), but
fixed-point math, the sine and cosine lookup, and selective assembly
optimizations have done a pretty good job already. The bulk of the time
taken by X-Sharp is now spent drawing polygons, drawing rectangles (to
erase objects), and waiting for the page to flip. In other words, we've
slain the dragon of 3-D math, or at least wounded it grievously; now
we're back to the dragon of polygon filling. We'll address faster
polygon filling soon, but for the moment, we have more than enough
horsepower to have some fun with. First, though, we need one more
feature: hidden surfaces.

#### Hidden Surfaces

So far, we've made a number of simplifying assumptions in order to get
the animation to look good; for example, all objects must currently be
convex polyhedrons. What's more, right now, objects can never pass
behind or in front of each other. What that means is that it's time to
have a look at hidden surfaces.

There are a passel of ways to do hidden surfaces. Way off at one end
(the slow end) of the spectrum is Z-buffering, whereby each pixel of
each polygon is checked as it's drawn to see whether it's the frontmost
version of the pixel at those coordinates. At the other end is the
technique of simply drawing the objects in back-to-front order, so that
nearer objects are drawn on top of farther objects. The latter approach,
depth sorting, is the one we'll take today. (Actually, true depth
sorting involves detecting and resolving possible ambiguities when
objects overlap in Z; in this chapter, we'll simply sort the objects on
Z and leave it at that.)

This limited version of depth sorting is fast but less than perfect. For
one thing, it doesn't address the issue of nonconvex objects, so we'll
have to stick with convex polyhedrons. For another, there's the question
of what part of each object to use as the sorting key; the nearest
point, the center, and the farthest point are all possibilities—and,
whichever point is used, depth sorting doesn't handle some overlap cases
properly. Figure 53.1 illustrates one case in which back-to-front
sorting doesn't work, regardless of what point is used as the sorting
key.

For photo-realistic rendering, these are serious problems. For fast
PC-based animation, however, they're manageable. Choose objects that
aren't too elongated; arrange their paths of travel so they don't
intersect in problematic ways; and, if they do overlap incorrectly,
trust that the glitch will be lost in the speed of the animation and the
complexity of the screen.

Listing 53.2 shows X-Sharp file OLIST.C, which includes the key routines
for depth sorting. Objects are now stored in a linked list. The initial,
empty list, created by `InitializeObjectList()`, consists of a
sentinel entry at either end, one at the farthest possible z coordinate,
and one at the nearest. New entries are inserted by `AddObject()` in
z-sorted order. Each time the objects are moved, before they're drawn at
their new locations, `SortObjects()` is called to Z-sort the object
list, so that drawing will proceed from back to front. The Z-sorting is
done on the basis of the objects' center points; a center-point field
has been added to the object structure to support this, and the center
point for each object is now transformed along with the vertices. That's
really all there is to depth sorting—and now we can have objects that
overlap in X and Y.

properly.*](../images/53-01.jpg)

      }
   }
}
```

#### Rounding

FIXED.ASM contains the equate **ROUNDING-ON**. When this equate is 1,
the results of multiplications and divisions are rounded to the nearest
fixed-point values; when it's 0, the results are truncated. The
difference between the results produced by the two approaches is, at
most, 2^-16^; you wouldn't think that would make much difference, now,
would you? But it does. When the animation is run with rounding
disabled, the cubes start to distort visibly after a few minutes, and
after a few minutes more they look like they've been run over. In
contrast, I've never seen any significant distortion with rounding on,
even after a half-hour or so. I think the difference with rounding is
not that it's so much more accurate, but rather that the errors are
evenly distributed; with truncation, the errors are biased, and biased
errors become very visible when they're applied to right-angle objects.
Even with rounding, though, the errors will eventually creep in, and
reorthogonalization will become necessary at some point.

The performance cost of rounding is small, and the benefits are highly
visible. Still, truncation errors become significant only when they
accumulate over time, as, for example, when rotation matrices are
repeatedly concatenated over the course of many transformations. Some
time could be saved by rounding only in such cases. For example,
division is performed only in the course of projection, and the results
do not accumulate over time, so it would be reasonable to disable
rounding for division.

#### Having a Ball

So far in our exploration of 3-D animation, we've had nothing to look at
but triangles and cubes. It's time for something a little more visually
appealing, so the demonstration program now features a 72-sided ball.
What's particularly interesting about this ball is that it's created by
the GENBALL.C program in the BALL subdirectory of X-Sharp, and both the
size of the ball and the number of bands of faces are programmable.
GENBALL.C spits out to a file all the arrays of vertices and faces
needed to create the ball, ready for inclusion in INITBALL.C. True, if
you change the number of bands, you must change the Colors array in
INITBALL.C to match, but that's a tiny detail; by and large, the process
of generating a ball-shaped object is now automated. In fact, we're not
limited to ball-shaped objects; substitute a different vertex and face
generation program for GENBALL.C, and you can make whatever convex
polyhedron you want; again, all you have to do is change the `Colors`
array correspondingly. You can easily create multiple versions of the
base object, too; INITCUBE.C is an example of this, creating 11
different cubes.

What we have here is the first glimmer of an object-editing system.
GENBALL.C is the prototype for object definition, and INITBALL.C is the
prototype for general-purpose object instantiation. Certainly, it would
be nice to someday have an interactive 3-D object editing tool and
resource management setup. We have our hands full with the drawing end
of things at the moment, though, and for now it's enough to be able to
create objects in a semiautomated way.
