## Chapter 41 -- Those Way-Down Polygon Nomenclature Blues

### Names Do Matter when You Conceptualize a Data Structure

After I wrote the columns on polygons in *Dr. Dobb's Journal* that
became Chapters 38-40, long-time reader Bill Huber wrote to take me to
task—and a well-deserved kick in the fanny it was, I might add—for my
use of non-standard polygon terminology in those columns. Unix's
X-Window System (XWS) defines three categories of polygons: complex,
nonconvex, and convex. These three categories, each a specialized subset
of the preceding category, not-so-coincidentally map quite nicely to
three increasingly fast polygon filling techniques. Therefore, I used
the XWS names to describe the sorts of polygons that can be drawn with
each of the polygon filling techniques.

The problem is that those names don't accurately describe all the sorts
of polygons that the techniques are capable of drawing. Convex polygons
are those for which no interior angle is greater than 180 degrees. The
"convex" drawing approach described in the previous few chapters
actually handles a number of polygons that are not convex; in fact, it
can draw any polygon through which no horizontal line can be drawn that
intersects the boundary more than twice. (In other words, the boundary
reverses the Y direction exactly twice, disregarding polygons that have
degenerated into horizontal lines, which I'm going to ignore.)

Bill was kind enough to send me the pages out of *Computational
Geometry, An Introduction* (Springer-Verlag, 1988) that describe the
correct terminology; such polygons are, in fact, "monotone with respect
to a vertical line" (which unfortunately makes a rather long
`#define` variable). Actually, to be a tad more precise, I'd call
them "monotone with respect to a vertical line and simple," where
"simple" means "not self-intersecting." Similarly, the polygon type I
called "nonconvex" is actually "simple," and I suppose what I called
"complex" should be referred to as "nonsimple," or maybe just "none of
the above."

Or, as Bill Huber put it, "You are free to adopt your own terminology
when it suits your purposes well. But you risk losing or confusing those
who could be among your most astute readers—those who already have been
trained in the same or a related field." Ditto. Likewise. *D'accord*.
And *mea culpa* ; I shall endeavor to watch my language in the future.

### Nomenclature in Action

Just to show you how much difference proper description and interchange
of ideas can make, consider the case of identifying convex polygons.
When I was writing about polygons in my column in *DDJ*, a nonfunctional
method for identifying such polygons—checking for exactly two X
direction changes and two Y direction changes around the perimeter of
the polygon—crept into the column by accident. That method, as I noted
in a later column, does not work. (That's why you won't find it in this
book.) Still, a fast method of checking for convex polygons would be
highly desirable, because such polygons can be drawn with the fast code
from Chapter 39, rather than the relatively slow, general-purpose code
from Chapter 40.

Now consider Bill's point that we're not limited to drawing convex
polygons in our "convex fill" code, but can actually handle any simple
polygon that's monotone with respect to a vertical line. Additionally,
consider Anton Treuenfels's point, made back in Chapter 40, that life
gets simpler if we stop worrying about which edge of a polygon is the
left edge and which is the right, and instead just scan out each raster
line starting at whichever edge is left-most. Now, what do we have?

What we have is an approach passed along by Jim Kent, of Autodesk
Animator fame. If we modify the low-level code to check which edge is
left-most on each scan line and start drawing there, as just described,
then we can handle any polygon that's monotone with respect to a
vertical line regardless of whether the edges cross. (I'll call this
"monotone-vertical" from now on; if anyone wants to correct that
terminology, jump right in.) In other words, we can then handle
nonsimple polygons that are monotone-vertical; self-intersection is no
longer a problem. We just scan around the polygon's perimeter looking
for exactly two direction reversals along the Y axis only, and if that
proves to be the case, we can handle the polygon at high speed. Figure
41.1 shows polygons that can be drawn by a monotone-vertical capable
filler; Figure 41.2 shows some that cannot. Listing 41.1 shows code to
test whether a polygon is appropriately monotone.

**LISTING 41.1 L41-1.C**

```c
/* Returns 1 if polygon described by passed-in vertex list is monotone with
respect to a vertical line, 0 otherwise. Doesn't matter if polygon is simple 
(non-self-intersecting) or not. Tested with Borland C++ in small model. */

#include "polygon.h"

#define SIGNUM(a) ((a>0)?1:((a<0)?-1:0))

int PolygonIsMonotoneVertical(struct PointListHeader * VertexList)
{
   int i, Length, DeltaYSign, PreviousDeltaYSign;
   int NumYReversals = 0;
   struct Point *VertexPtr = VertexList->PointPtr;

   /* Three or fewer points can't make a non-vertical-monotone polygon */
   if ((Length=VertexList->Length) < 4) return(1);

   /* Scan to the first non-horizontal edge */
   PreviousDeltaYSign = SIGNUM(VertexPtr[Length-1].Y - VertexPtr[0].Y);
   i = 0;
   while ((PreviousDeltaYSign == 0) && (i < (Length-1))) {
      PreviousDeltaYSign = SIGNUM(VertexPtr[i].Y - VertexPtr[i+1].Y);
      i++;
   }

   if (i == (Length-1)) return(1);  /* polygon is a flat line */

   /* Now count Y reversals. Might miss one reversal, at the last vertex, but 
      because reversal counts must be even, being off by one isn't a problem */
   do {
      if ((DeltaYSign = SIGNUM(VertexPtr[i].Y - VertexPtr[i+1].Y))
            != 0) {
         if (DeltaYSign != PreviousDeltaYSign) {
            /* Switched Y direction; not vertical-monotone if
               reversed Y direction as many as three times */
            if (++NumYReversals > 2) return(0);
            PreviousDeltaYSign = DeltaYSign;
         }
      }
   } while (i++ < (Length-1));
   return(1);  /* it's a vertical-monotone polygon */
}
```

Listings 41.2 and 41.3 are variants of the fast convex polygon fill code
from Chapter 39, modified to be able to handle all monotone-vertical
polygons, including nonsimple ones; the edge-scanning code (Listing 39.4
from Chapter 39) remains the same, and so is not shown again here.

![**Figure 41.1**  *Monotone-vertical polygons.*](../images/41-01.jpg)

![**Figure 41.2**  *Non-monotone-vertical polygons.*](../images/41-02.jpg)

**LISTING 41.2 L41-2.C**

```c
/* Color-fills a convex polygon. All vertices are offset by (XOffset, YOffset).
"Convex" means "monotone with respect to a vertical line"; that is, every 
horizontal line drawn through the polygon at any point would cross exactly two 
active edges (neither horizontal lines nor zero-length edges count as active 
edges; both are acceptable anywhere in the polygon). Right & left edges may 
cross (polygons may be nonsimple). Polygons that are not convex according to 
this definition won't be drawn properly. (Yes, "convex" is a lousy name for 
this type of polygon, but it's convenient; use "monotone-vertical" if it makes 
you happier!)
*******************************************************************
NOTE: the low-level drawing routine, DrawHorizontalLineList, must be able to
reverse the edges, if necessary to make the correct edge left edge. It must 
also expect right edge to be specified in +1 format (the X coordinate is 1 past
highest coordinate to draw). In both respects, this differs from low-level 
drawing routines presented in earlier columns; changes are necessary to make it
possible to draw nonsimple monotone-vertical polygons; that in turn makes it 
possible to use Jim Kent's test for monotone-vertical polygons.

Listing 41.4 is almost identical to Listing 40.1 from Chapter 40. I've
modified Listing 40.1 to employ the vertical-monotone detection test
we've been talking about and use the fast vertical-monotone drawing code
whenever possible; that's what Listing 41.4 is. Note well that Listing
40.5 from Chapter 40 is also required in order for this code to link.
Listing 41.5 is an appropriately updated version of the POLYGON.H header
file.

**LISTING 41.4 L41-4.C**

```c
/* Color-fills an arbitrarily-shaped polygon described by VertexList.
If the first and last points in VertexList are not the same, the path
around the polygon is automatically closed. All vertices are offset
by (XOffset, YOffset). Returns 1 for success, 0 if memory allocation
failed. All C code tested with Borland C++.

If the polygon shape is known in advance, speedier processing may be
enabled by specifying the shape as follows: "convex" - a rubber band
stretched around the polygon would touch every vertex in order;
"nonconvex" - the polygon is not self-intersecting, but need not be
convex; "complex" - the polygon may be self-intersecting, or, indeed,
any sort of polygon at all. Complex will work for all polygons; convex
is fastest. Undefined results will occur if convex is specified for a
nonconvex or complex polygon.

Define CONVEX_CODE_LINKED if the fast convex polygon filling code from
the February 1991 column is linked in. Otherwise, convex polygons are
handled by the complex polygon filling code.
Nonconvex is handled as complex in this implementation. See text for a
discussion of faster nonconvex handling. */

Is monotone-vertical polygon detection worth all this trouble? Under the
right circumstances, you bet. In a situation where a great many polygons
are being drawn, and the application either doesn't know whether they're
monotone-vertical or has no way to tell the polygon filler that they
are, performance can be increased considerably if most polygons are, in
fact, monotone-vertical. This potential performance advantage is helped
along by the surprising fact that Jim's test for monotone-vertical
status is simpler and faster than my original, nonfunctional test for
convexity.
