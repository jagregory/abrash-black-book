## Chapter 21 -- Unleashing the Pentium's V-Pipe

### Focusing on Keeping Both Pentium Pipes Full

The other day, my daughter suggested that we each draw the prettiest
picture we could, then see whose was prettier. I won't comment on who
won, except to note that apparently a bolt of lightning zipping toward a
moose with antlers that bear an unfortunate resemblance to a propeller
beanie isn't going to win me any scholarships to art school, if you
catch my drift. Anyway, my drawing happened to feature the word
"chartreuse" (because it rhymed with "moose" and "Zeus"—hence the
lightning; more than that I am not at liberty to divulge), and she
wanted to know if the moose was actually chartreuse. I had to admit that
I didn't know, so we went to the dictionary, whereupon we learned that
chartreuse is a pale apple-green color. Then she brought up the Windows
Control Panel, pointed to the selection of predefined colors, and asked,
"Which of those is chartreuse?"—and I realized that I *still* didn't
know.

Some things can be described perfectly with words, but others just have
to be experienced. Color is one such category, and Pentium optimization
is another. I've spent the last two chapters detailing the rules for
Pentium optimization, and I'll spend half of this one doing so, as well.
That's good; without understanding the fundamentals, we have no chance
of optimizing well. It's not enough, though. We also need to look at a
real-world example of Pentium optimization in action, and we'll do that
later in this chapter; after which, you should go out and do some
Pentium optimization on your own. Optimization is one of those things
that you can learn a lot about from reading, but ultimately it has to
sink into your pores as you do it—especially Pentium optimization
because the Pentium is perhaps the most complex (and rewarding) chip to
optimize for that I've ever seen.

In the last chapter, we explored the dual-execution-pipe nature of the
Pentium, and learned which instructions could pair (execute
simultaneously) in which pipes. Now we're ready to look at AGIs and
register contention—two hazards that can prevent otherwise properly
written code from taking full advantage of the Pentium's two pipes, and
can thereby keep your code from pushing the Pentium to maximum
performance.

### Address Generation Interlocks

The Pentium is advertised as having a five-stage pipeline for each of
its execution units. All this means is that at any given time, up to
five instructions are in various stages of execution in each pipe; this
overlapping of execution is done for speed, so each instruction doesn't
have to wait until the previous one has finished. The only way that the
Pentium's pipelining directly affects the way you program is in the
areas of AGIs and register dependencies.

AGIs are *Address Generation Interlocks*, a fancy way of saying that if
a register is used to address memory, as is EBX in this instruction

```nasm
mov [ebx],eax
```

and the value of the register is not set far enough ahead for the
Pentium to perform the addressing calculations before the instruction
needs the address, then the Pentium will stall the pipe in which the
instruction is executing until the value becomes available and the
addressing calculations have been performed. Remember, also, that
instructions execute in lockstep on the Pentium, so if one pipe stalls
for a cycle, making its instruction take one cycle longer, that extends
by one cycle the time until the other pipe can begin its next
instruction, as well.

The rule for AGIs is simple: If you modify any part of a register during
a cycle, you cannot use that register to address memory during either
that cycle or the next cycle. If you try to do this, the Pentium will
simply stall the instruction that tries to use that register to address
memory until two cycles after the register was modified. This was true
on the 486 as well, but the Pentium's new twist is that since more than
one instruction can execute in a single cycle, an AGI can stall an
instruction that's as many as three instructions away from the changing
of the addressing register, as shown in Figure 21.1, and an AGI can also
cause a stall that costs as many as three instructions, as shown in
Figure 21.2. This means that AGIs are both much easier to cause and
potentially more expensive than on the 486, and you must keep a sharp
eye out for them. It also means that it's often worth calculating a
memory pointer several instructions ahead of its actual use.
Unfortunately, this tends to extend the lifetimes of pointer registers
to span a greater number of instructions, making the Pentium's
relatively small register set seem even smaller.

![**Figure 21.1**  *An AGI can stall up to three instructions later.*](../images/21-01.jpg)

As an example of a sort of AGI that's new to the Pentium, consider the
following test for a NULL pointer, followed by the use of the pointer if
it's not NULL:

```nasm
push ebx          ;U-pipe cycle 1
mov  ebx,[Ptr]    ;V-pipe cycle 1
and  ebx,ebx      ;U-pipe cycle 2
jz   short IsNull ;V-pipe cycle 2
mov  eax,[ebx]    ;U-pipe cycle 3 AGI stall
mov  edx,[ebp-8]  ;V-pipe cycle 3 lockstep idle
                  ;U-pipe cycle 4 mov eax,[ebx]
                  ;V-pipe cycle 4 mov edx,[ebp-8]
```

This commonplace code loses a U-pipe cycle to the AGI caused by `AND
EBX,EBX`, followed by the attempt two instructions later to use EBX to
point to memory. The code loses a V-pipe cycle as well, because lockstep
execution won't let the next V-pipe instruction execute until the paired
U-pipe instruction that suffered the AGI finishes. The solution is to
use `TEST EBX,EBX` instead of `AND; TEST` can't modify EBX, so no
AGI occurs. Sure, `AND EBX,EBX` doesn't modify EBX either, but the
Pentium doesn't know that, so it has to insert the AGI.

![**Figure 21.2**  *An AGI can cost as many as 3 cycles.*](../images/21-02.jpg)

As on the 486, you should keep a careful eye out for AGIs involving the
stack pointer. Implicit modifiers of ESP, such as `PUSH` and `POP`,
are special-cased so you don't have to worry about AGIs. However, if you
explicitly modify ESP with this instruction

```nasm
sub esp,100h
```

for example, or with the popular

```nasm
mov esp,ebp
```

you can then get AGIs if you attempt to use ESP to address memory,
either explicitly with instructions like this one

```nasm
moveax,[esp+20h]
```

or via `PUSH`, `POP`, or other instructions that implicitly use ESP
as an addressing register.

On the 486, any instruction that had both a constant value and an
addressing displacement, such as

```nasm
mov dword ptr [ebp+16],1
```

suffered a 1-cycle penalty, taking a total of 2 cycles. Such
instructions take only one cycle on the Pentium, but they cannot pair,
so they're still the most expensive sort of `MOV`. Knowing this can
speed up something as simple as zeroing two memory variables, as in

```nasm
sub eax,eax        ;U-pipe 1
                   ;any V-pipe pairable
                   ; instruction can go here,
                   ; or SUB could be in V-pipe
mov [MemVar1],eax  ;U-pipe 2
mov [MemVar2],eax  ;V-pipe 2
```

which should never be slower and should potentially be 0.5 cycles
faster, and six bytes smaller than this sequence:

```nasm
mov [MemVar1],0 ;U-pipe 1
mov [MemVar2],0 ;U-pipe 2
```

Note, however, that my experiments thus far indicate that the two writes
in the first case don't actually pair (possibly because the memory
variables have never been read into the internal cache), so you might
want to insert an instruction between the two `MOV`s—and, of course,
this is yet another reason why you should always measure your code's
actual performance.

### Register Contention

Finally, we come to the last major component of superscalar
optimization: register contention. The basic premise here is simple: You
can't use the same register in two inherently sequential ways in a
single cycle. For example, you can't execute

```nasm
inc eax     ;U-pipe cycle 1
            ;V-pipe idle cycle 1
            ; due to dependency
and ebx,eax ;U-pipe cycle 2
```

in a single cycle; `AND EBX,EAX` can't execute until the value in EAX
is known, and that can't happen until `INC EAX` is done. Consequently,
the V-pipe idles while `INC EAX` executes in the U-pipe. We saw this
in the last chapter when we discussed splitting instructions into simple
instructions, and it is by far the most common sort of register
contention, known as read-after-write register contention.
Read-after-write register contention is the primary reason we have to
interleave independent operations in order to get maximum V-pipe usage.

The other sort of register contention is known as write-after-write.
Write-after-write register contention happens when two instructions try
to write to the same register on the same cycle. While that may not seem
like a particularly useful operation in general, it can happen when
subregisters are being set, as in the following

```nasm
sub eax,eax   ;U-pipe cycle 1
              ;V-pipe idle cycle 1
              ; due to register contention
mov al,[Var]  ;U-pipe cycle 2
```

where an attempt is made to set both EAX and its AL subregister on the
same cycle. Write-after-write contention implies that the two
instructions comprising the above substitute for `MOVZX` should have
at least one unrelated instruction between them when `SUB EAX,EAX`
executes in the V-pipe.

#### Exceptions to Register Contention

Intel has special-cased some very useful exceptions to register
contention. Happily, write-after-read operations do *not* cause
contention. Such operations, as in

```nasm
mov eax,edx ;U-pipe cycle 1
sub edx,edx ;V-pipe cycle 1
```

are free of charge.

Also, stack-related instructions that modify ESP only implicitly
(without ESP as part of any explicit operand) do not cause AGIs, and
neither do they cause register contention with other instructions that
use ESP only implicitly; such instructions include `PUSH *reg/immed*,
POP *reg*`, and `CALL`. (However, these instructions do cause
register contention on ESP—but not AGIs—with instructions that use ESP
explicitly, such as `MOV EAX,[ESP+4]`.) Without this special case, the
following sequence would hardly use the V-pipe at all:

```nasm
mov  eax,[MemVar] ;U-pipe cycle 1
push esi          ;V-pipe cycle 1
push eax          ;U-pipe cycle 2
push edi          ;V-pipe cycle 2
push ebx          ;U-pipe cycle 3
call FooTilde     ;V-pipe cycle 3
```

But in fact, all the instructions pair, even though ESP is modified five
times in the space of six instructions.

The final register-contention special case is both remarkable and
remarkably important. There is exactly one sort of instruction that can
pair only in the V-pipe: branches. Any near call or conditional or
unconditional near jump can execute in the V-pipe paired with any
pairable U-pipe instruction, as illustrated by this sequence:

```nasm
LoopTop:
   mov [esi],eax ;U-pipe cycle 1
   add esi,4     ;V-pipe cycle 1
   dec ecx       ;U-pipe cycle 2
   jnz LoopTop   ;V-pipe cycle 2
```

Branches can't pair in the U-pipe; a branch that executes in the U-pipe
runs alone, with the V-pipe idle. If a call or jump is correctly
predicted by the Pentium's branch prediction circuitry (as discussed in
the last chapter), it executes in a single cycle, pairing if it runs in
the V-pipe; if mispredicted, conditional jumps take 4 cycles in the
U-pipe and 5 cycles in the V-pipe, and mispredicted calls and
unconditional jumps take 3 cycles in either pipe. Note that `RET`
can't pair.

### Who's in First?

One of the trickiest things about superscalar optimization is that a
given instruction stream can execute at a different speed depending on
the pipe where it starts execution, because which instruction goes
through the U-pipe first determines which of the following instructions
will be able to pair. If we take the last example and add one more
instruction, the other instructions will go through different pipes than
previously, and cause the loop as a whole to take 50 percent longer,
even though we only added 25 percent more cycles:

```nasm
LoopTop:
   inc edx           ;U-pipe cycle 1
   mov [esi],eax     ;V-pipe cycle 1
   add esi,4         ;U-pipe cycle 2
   dec ecx           ;V-pipe cycle 2
   jnz LoopTop       ;U-pipe cycle 3
                     ;V-pipe idle cycle 3
                     ; because JNZ can't
                     ; pair in the U-pipe
```

It's actually not hard to figure out which instructions go through which
pipes; just back up until you find an instruction that can't pair or can
only go through the U-pipe, and work forward from there, given the
knowledge that that instruction executes in the U-pipe. The easiest
thing to look for is branches. All branch target instructions execute in
the U-pipe, as do all instructions after conditional branches that fall
through. Instructions with prefix bytes are generally good U-pipe
markers, although they're expensive instructions that should be avoided
whenever possible, and have at least one aberration with regard to pipe
usage, as discussed below. Shifts, rotates, `ADC, SBB`, and all other
instructions not listed in Table 20.1 in the last chapter are likewise
U-pipe markers.

### Pentium Optimization in Action

Now, let's take a look at one of the simplest, tightest pieces of code
imaginable, and see what our new Pentium perspective reveals. Listing
21.1 shows a loop implementing the TCP/IP checksum, a 16-bit checksum
that wraps carries around to the low bit so that the result is
endian-independent. This makes it easy to perform checksums on blocks of
data regardless of the endian characteristics of the machines on which
those blocks are generated and received. (Thanks to fellow performance
enthusiast Terje Mathisen for suggesting this checksum as fertile ground
for Pentium optimization, in the ibm.pc/fast.code forum on Bix.) The
loop in Listing 21.1 consists of exactly five instructions; it's hard to
imagine that there's a lot of performance to be wrung from this snippet,
right?

**LISTING 21.1 L21-1.ASM**

```nasm
; Calculates TCP/IP (16-bit carry-wrapping) checksum for buffer
;  starting at ESI, of length ECX words.
; Returns checksum in AX.
; ECX and ESI destroyed.
; All cycle counts assume 32-bit protected mode.
; Assumes buffer length > 0.
; Note that timing indicates that the pipe sequence and
;  cycle counts shown (based on documented execution rules)
;  differ from the actual execution sequence and cycle counts;
;  this loop has been measured to execute in 5 cycles; apparently,
;  the 1st half of ADD somehow pairs with the prefix byte, or the
;  refix byte gets executed ahead of time.

        sub     ax,ax           ;initialize the checksum

ckloop:
        add     ax,[esi]        ;cycle 1 U-pipe prefix byte
                                ;cycle 1 V-pipe idle (no pairing w/prefix)
                                ;cycle 2 U-pipe 1st half of ADD
                                ;cycle 2 V-pipe idle (register contention)
                                ;cycle 3 U-pipe 2nd half of ADD
                                ;cycle 3 V-pipe idle (register contention)
        adc     ax,0            ;cycle 4 U-pipe prefix byte
                                ;cycle 4 V-pipe idle (no pairing w/prefix)
                                ;cycle 5 U-pipe ADC AX,0
        add     esi,2           ;cycle 5 V-pipe
        dec     ecx             ;cycle 6 U-pipe
        jnz     ckloop          ;cycle 6 V-pipe
```

Wrong, wrong, wrong! As detailed in Listing 21.1, this loop should take
6 cycles per checksummed word in 32-bit protected mode, a ridiculously
high number for the Pentium. (You'll see why I say "should take," not
"takes," shortly.) We should lose 2 cycles in each pipe to the two size
prefixes (because the `ADD`s are 16-bit operations in a 32-bit
segment), and another 2 cycles because of register contention that
arises when `ADC AX,0` has to wait for the result of `ADD AX,[ESI]`.
Then, too, even though `DEC` and `JNZ` can pair and the branch
prediction for `JNZ` is presumably correct virtually all the time,
they do take a full cycle, and maybe we can do something about that as
well.

The first thing to do is to time the code in Listing 21.1 to verify our
analysis. When I unleashed the Zen timer on Listing 21.1, I found, to my
surprise, that the code actually takes only five cycles per checksum
word processed, not six. A little more experimentation revealed that
adding a size prefix to the two-cycle `ADD EAX,[ESI]` instruction
doesn't cost anything, certainly not the one full cycle in each pipe
that a prefix is supposed to take. More experimentation showed that
prefix bytes do cost the documented extra cycle when used with one-cycle
instructions such as `MOV`. At this point, my preliminary conclusion
is that prefixes can pair with the first cycle of at least some
multiple-cycle instructions. Determining exactly why this happens will
take further research on my part, but the most important conclusion is
that you *must* measure your code!

The first, obvious thing we can do to Listing 21.1 is change `ADC AX,0` to
`ADC EAX,0`, eliminating a prefix byte and saving a full cycle. Now we're
down from five to four cycles. What next?

Listing 21.2 shows one interesting alternative that doesn't really buy
us anything. Here, we've eliminated all size prefixes by doing
byte-sized `MOVs` and `ADDs`, but because the size prefix on `ADD 
AX,[ESI]`, for whatever reason, didn't cost anything in Listing 21.1,
our efforts are to no avail—Listing 21.2 still takes 4 cycles per
checksummed word. What's worth noting about Listing 21.2 is the extent
to which the code is broken into simple instructions and reordered so as
to avoid size prefixes, register contention, AGIs, and data bank
conflicts (the latter because both `[ESI]` and `[ESI+1]` are in the
same cache data bank, as discussed in the last chapter).

**LISTING 21.2 L21-2.ASM**

```nasm

        sub     eax,eax         ;initialize the checksum
        mov     dx,[esi]        ;first word to checksum
        dec     ecx             ;we'll do 1 checksum outside the loop
        jz      short ckloopend ;only 1 checksum to do
        add     esi,2           ;point to the next word to checksum

ckloop:
        add     al,dl           ;cycle 1 U-pipe
        mov     dl,[esi]        ;cycle 1 V-pipe
        adc     ah,dh           ;cycle 2 U-pipe
        mov     dh,[esi+1]      ;cycle 2 V-pipe
        adc     eax,0           ;cycle 3 U-pipe
        add     esi,2           ;cycle 3 V-pipe
        dec     ecx             ;cycle 4 U-pipe
        jnz     ckloop          ;cycle 4 V-pipe

ckloopend:
        add     ax,dx           ;checksum the last word
        adc     eax,0
```

Listing 21.3 is a more sophisticated attempt to speed up the checksum
calculation. Here we see a hallmark of Pentium optimization: two
operations (the checksumming of the current and next pair of words)
interleaved together to allow both pipes to run at near maximum
capacity. Another hallmark that's apparent in Listing 21.3 is that
Pentium-optimized code tends to use more registers and require more
instructions than 486-optimized code. Again, note the careful mixing of
byte-sized reads to avoid AGIs, register contention, and cache bank
collisions, in particular the way in which the byte reads of memory are
interspersed with the additions to avoid register contention, and the
placement of `ADD ESI,4` to avoid an AGI.

        adc     eax,0
ckloopdone:
```

The checksum loop in Listing 21.3 takes longer than the loop in Listing
21.2, at 6 cycles versus 4 cycles for Listing 21.2—but Listing 21.3 does
two checksum operations in those 6 cycles, so we've cut the time per
checksum addition from 4 to 3 cycles. You might think that this small an
improvement doesn't justify the additional complexity of Listing 21.3,
but it is a one-third speedup, well worth it if this is a critical
loop—and, in general, if it isn't critical, there's no point in
hand-tuning it. That's why I haven't bothered to try to optimize the
non-inner-loop code in Listing 21.3; it's only executed once per
checksum, so it's unlikely that a cycle or two saved there would make
any real-world difference.

Listing 21.3 could be made a bit faster yet with some loop unrolling,
but that would make the code quite a bit more complex for relatively
little return. Instead, why not make the code more complex and get a
*big* return? Listing 21.4 does exactly that by loading one dword at a
time to eliminate both the word prefix of Listing 21.1 and the multiple
byte-sized accesses of Listing 21.3. An obvious drawback to this is the
considerable complexity needed to ensure that the dword accesses are
dword-aligned (remember that unaligned dword accesses cost three cycles
each), and to handle buffer lengths that aren't dword multiples. I've
handled these problems by requiring that the buffer be dword-aligned and
a dword multiple in length, which is of course not always the case in
the real world. However, the point of these listings is to illustrate
Pentium optimization—dword issues, being non-inner-loop stuff, are
solvable details that aren't germane to the main focus. In any case, the
complexity and assumptions are well justified by the performance of this
code: three cycles per loop, or 1.5 cycles per checksummed word, more
than three times the speed of the original code. Again, note that the
actual order in which the instructions are arranged is dictated by the
various optimization hazards of the Pentium.

**LISTING 21.4 L21-4.ASM**

Listing 21.5 improves upon Listing 21.4 by processing 2 dwords per loop,
thereby bringing the time per checksummed word down to exactly 1 cycle.
Listing 21.5 basically does nothing but unroll Listing 21.4's loop one
time, demonstrating that the venerable optimization technique of loop
unrolling still has some life left in it on the Pentium. The cost for
this is, as usual, increased code size and complexity, and the use of
more registers.

Listing 21.5 is undeniably intricate code, and not the sort of thing one
would choose to write as a matter of course. On the other hand, it's
five times as fast as the tight, seemingly-speedy loop in Listing 21.1
(and six times as fast as Listing 21.1 would have been if the prefix
byte had behaved as expected). That's an awful lot of speed to wring out
of a five-instruction loop, and the TCP/IP checksum is, in fact, used by
network software, an area in which a five-times speedup might make a
significant difference in overall system performance.

I don't claim that Listing 21.5 is the fastest possible way to do a
TCP/IP checksum on a Pentium; in fact, it isn't. Unrolling the loop one
more time, together with a trick of Terje's that uses `LEA` to advance
ESI (neither `LEA` nor `DEC` affects the carry flag, allowing Terje
to add the carry from the previous loop iteration into the next
iteration's checksum via `ADC`), produces a version that's a full 33
percent faster. Nonetheless, Listings 21.1 through 21.5 illustrate many
of the techniques and considerations in Pentium optimization.
Hand-optimization for the Pentium isn't simple, and requires careful
measurement to check the efficacy of your optimizations, so reserve it
for when you really, really need it—but when you need it, you need it
*bad*.

#### A Quick Note on the 386 and 486

I've mentioned that Pentium-optimized code does fine on the 486, but not
always so well on the 386. On a 486, Listing 21.1 runs at 9 cycles per
checksummed word, and Listing 21.5 runs at 2.5 cycles per checksummed
word, a healthy 3.6-times speedup. On a 386, Listing 21.1 runs at 22
cycles per word; Listing 21.5 runs at 7 cycles per word, a 3.1-times
speedup. As is often the case, Pentium optimization helped the other
processors, but not as much as it helped the Pentium, and less on the
386 than on the 486.
