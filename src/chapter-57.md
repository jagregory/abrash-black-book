## Chapter 57 -- 10,000 Freshly Sheared Sheep on the Screen

### The Critical Role of Experience in Implementing Fast, Smooth Texture Mapping

I recently spent an hour or so learning how to shear a sheep. Among
other things, I learned—in great detail—about the importance of
selecting the proper comb for your shears, heard about the man who holds
the world's record for sheep sheared in a day (more than 600, if memory
serves), and discovered, Lord help me, the many and varied ways in which
the New Zealand Sheep Shearing Board improves the approved
sheep-shearing method every year. The fellow giving the presentation did
his best, but let's face it, sheep just aren't very interesting. If you
have children, you'll know why I was there; if you don't, there's no use
explaining.

The chap doing the shearing did say one thing that stuck with me,
although it may not sound particularly profound. (Actually, it sounds
pretty silly, but bear with me.) He said, "You don't get really good at
sheep shearing for 10 years, or 10,000 sheep." I'll buy that. In fact,
to extend that morsel of wisdom to the greater, non-ovine-centric
universe, it actually takes a good chunk of experience before you get
good at anything worthwhile—especially graphics, for a couple of
reasons. First, performance matters a lot in graphics, and performance
programming is largely a matter of experience. You can't speed up PC
graphics simply by looking in a book for a better algorithm; you have to
understand the code C compilers generate, assembly language
optimization, VGA hardware, and the performance implications of various
graphics-programming approaches and algorithms. Second, computer
graphics is a matter of illusion, of convincing the eye to see what you
want it to see, and that's very much a black art based on experience.

#### Visual Quality: A Black Hole ... Er, Art

Pleasing the eye with realtime computer animation is something less than
a science, at least at the PC level, where there's a limited color
palette and no time for antialiasing; in fact, sometimes it can be more
than a little frustrating. As you may recall, in the previous chapter I
implemented texture mapping in X-Sharp. There was plenty of experience
involved there, some of which I didn't mention. My first implementation
was disappointing; the texture maps shimmied and sheared badly, like a
loosely affiliated flock of pixels, each marching to its own drummer.
Then, I added a control key to speed up the rotation; what a difference!
The aliasing problems were still there, but with the faster rotation,
the pixels moved too quickly for the eye to pick up on the aliasing; the
rotating texture maps, and the rotating ball as a whole, crossed the
threshold into being accepted by the eye as a viewed object, rather than
simply a collection of pixels.

The obvious lesson here is that adequate speed is important to
convincing animation. There's another, less obvious side to this lesson,
though. I'd been running the texture-mapping demo on a 20 MHz 386 with a
slow VGA when I discovered the beneficial effects of greater animation
speed. When, some time later, I ran the demo on a 33 MHz 486 with a fast
VGA, I found that the faster rotation was too fast! The ball spun so
rapidly that the eye couldn't blend successive images together into
continuous motion, much like watching a badly flickering movie.

#### Fixed-Point Arithmetic, Redux

In the previous chapter I added texture mapping to X-Sharp, but lacked
space to explain some of its finer points. I'll pick up the thread now
and cover some of those points here, and discuss the visual and
performance enhancements that previous chapter's code needed—and which
are now present in the version of X-Sharp in this chapter's subdirectory
on the CD-ROM.

Back in Chapter 38, I spent a good bit of time explaining exactly which
pixels were inside a polygon and which were outside, and how to draw
those pixels accordingly. This was important, I said, because only with
a precise, consistent way of defining inside and outside would it be
possible to draw adjacent polygons without either overlap or gaps
between them.

As a corollary, I added that only an all-integer, edge-stepping approach
would do for polygon filling. Fixed-point arithmetic, although alluring
for speed and ease of use, would be unacceptable because round-off error
would result in imprecise pixel placement.

More than a year then passed between the time I wrote that statement and
the time I implemented X-Sharp's texture mapper, during which time my
long-term memory apparently suffered at least partial failure. When I
went to implement texture mapping for the previous chapter, I decided
that since transformed destination vertices can fall at fractional pixel
locations, the cleanest way to do the texture mapping would be to use
fixed-point coordinates for both the source texture and the destination
screen polygon. That way, there would be a minimum of distortion as the
polygon rotated and moved. Theoretically, that made sense; but there was
one small problem: gaps between polygons.

Yes, folks, I had ignored the voice of experience (my own voice, at
that) at my own peril. You can be assured I will not forget this
particular lesson again: Fixed-point arithmetic is not precise. That's
not to say that it's impossible to use fixed-point for drawing polygons;
if all adjacent edges share common start and end vertices and common
edges are always stepped in the same direction, all polygons should
share the same fixed-point imprecision, and edges should fit properly
(although polygons may not include exactly the right pixels). What you
absolutely cannot do is mix fixed-point and all-integer polygon-filling
approaches when drawing, as shown in Figure 57.1. Consequently, I ended
up using an all-integer approach in X-Sharp for stepping through the
destination polygon. However, I kept the fixed-point approach, which is
faster and much simpler, for stepping through the source.

Why was it all right to mix approaches in this case? Precise pixel
placement only matters when drawing; otherwise, we can get gaps, which
are very visible. When selecting a pixel to copy from the source
texture, however, the worst that happens is that we pick the source
pixel next to the one we really want, causing the mapped texture to
appear to have shifted by one pixel at the corresponding destination
pixel; given all the aliasing and shearing already going on in the
texture-mapping process, a one-pixel mapping error is insignificant.

Experience again: It's the difference between knowing which flaws (like
small texture shifts) can reasonably be ignored, and which (like those
that produce gaps between polygons) must be avoided at all costs.

#### Texture Mapping: Orientation Independence

The double-DDA texture-mapping code presented in the previous chapter
worked adequately, but there were two things about it that left me less
than satisfied. One flaw was performance; I'll address that shortly. The
other flaw was the way textures shifted noticeably as the orientations
of the polygons onto which they were mapped changed.

The previous chapter's code followed the standard polygon inside/outside
rule for determining which pixels in the source texture map were to be
mapped: Pixels that mapped exactly to the left and top destination edges
were considered to be inside, and pixels that mapped exactly to the
right and bottom destination edges were considered to be outside. That's
fine for filling polygons, but when copying texture maps, it causes
different edges of the texture map to be omitted, depending on the
destination orientation, because different edges of the texture map
correspond to the right and bottom destination edges, depending on the
current rotation. Also, the previous chapter's code truncated to get
integer source coordinates. This, together with the orientation problem,
meant that when a texture turned upside down, it slowed one new row and
one new column of pixels from the next row and column of the texture
map. This asymmetry was quite visible, and not at all the desired
effect.

![**Figure 57.1**  *Gaps caused by mixing fixed-point and all-integer
math.*](../images/57-01.jpg)

Listing 57.1 is one solution to these problems. This code, which
replaces the equivalently named function presented in the previous
chapter (and, of course, is present in the X-Sharp archive in this
chapter's subdirectory of the listings disk), makes no attempt to follow
the standard polygon inside/outside rules when mapping the source.
Instead, it advances a half-step into the texture map before drawing the
first pixel, so pixels along all edges are half included. Rounding
rather than truncation to texture-map coordinates is also performed. The
result is that the texture map stays pretty much centered within the
destination polygon as the destination rotates, with a much-reduced
level of orientation-dependent asymmetry.

/* Texture-map-draw the scan line between two edges. Uses approach of

void ScanOutLine(EdgeScan * LeftEdge, EdgeScan * RightEdge)
{
   Fixedpoint SourceX;
   Fixedpoint SourceY;
   int DestX = LeftEdge->DestX;
   int DestXMax = RightEdge->DestX;
   Fixedpoint DestWidth;
   Fixedpoint SourceStepX, SourceStepY;

   /* Nothing to do if fully X clipped */
   if ((DestXMax <= ClipMinX) || (DestX >= ClipMaxX)) {
      return;
   }

   if ((DestXMax - DestX) <= 0) {
      return;  /* nothing to draw */
   }

   SourceY = LeftEdge->SourceY;

   /* Width of destination scan line, for scaling. Note: because this is an
      integer-based scaling, it can have a total error of as much as nearly
      one pixel. For more precise scaling, also maintain a fixed-point DestX
      in each edge, and use it for scaling. If this is done, it will also
      be necessary to nudge the source start coordinates to the right by an
      amount corresponding to the distance from the the real (fixed-point)

   DestWidth = INT-TO-FIXED(DestXMax - DestX);

   /* Calculate source steps that correspond to each dest X step (across
      the scan line) */
   SourceStepX = FixedDiv(RightEdge->SourceX - SourceX, DestWidth);
   SourceStepY = FixedDiv(RightEdge->SourceY - SourceY, DestWidth);

   /* Advance 1/2 step in the stepping direction, to space scanned pixels
      evenly between the left and right edges. (There's a slight inaccuracy
      in dividing negative numbers by 2 by shifting rather than dividing,
      but the inaccuracy is in the least significant bit, and we'll just
      live with it.) */
   SourceX += SourceStepX >> 1;
   SourceY += SourceStepY >> 1;

   /* Clip right edge if necssary */
   if (DestXMax > ClipMaxX)
      DestXMax = ClipMaxX;

   if (DestX < ClipMinX) {

      SourceY += SourceStepY;
   }
}

#### Mapping Textures across Multiple Polygons

One of the truly nifty things about double-DDA texture mapping is that
it is not limited to mapping a texture onto a single polygon. A single
texture can be mapped across any number of adjacent polygons simply by
having polygons that share vertices in 3-space also share vertices in
the texture map. In fact, the demonstration program DEMO1 in the X-Sharp
archive maps a single texture across two polygons; this is the
blue-on-green pattern that stretches across two panels of the spinning
ball. This capability makes it easy to produce polygon-based objects
with complex surfaces (such as banding and insignia on spaceships, or
even human figures). Just map the desired texture onto the underlying
polygonal framework of an object, and let double-DDA texture mapping do
the rest.

#### Fast Texture Mapping

Of course, there's a problem with mapping a texture across many
polygons: Texture mapping is slow. If you run DEMO1 and move the ball up
close to the screen, you'll see that the ball slows considerably
whenever a texture swings around into view. To some extent that can't be
helped, because each pixel of a texture-mapped polygon has to be
calculated and drawn independently. Nonetheless, we can certainly
improve the performance of texture mapping a good deal over what I
presented in the previous chapter.

By and large, there are two keys to improving PC graphics performance.
The first—no surprise—is assembly language. The second, without which
assembly language is far less effective, is understanding exactly where
the cycles go in inner loops. In our case, that means understanding
where the bottlenecks are in Listing 57.1.

Listing 57.2 is a high-performance assembly language implementation of
Listing 57.1. Apart from the conversion to assembly language, this
implementation improves performance by focusing on reducing inner loop
bottlenecks. In fact, the whole of Listing 57.2 is nothing more than the
inner loop for texture-mapped polygon drawing; Listing 57.2 is only the
code to draw a single scan line. Most of the work in drawing a
texture-mapped polygon comes in scanning out individual lines, though,
so this is the appropriate place to optimize.

Within Listing 57.2, all the important optimization is in the loop that
draws across each destination scan line, near the end of the listing.
One optimization is elimination of the call to the set-pixel routine
used to draw each pixel in Listing 57.1. Function calls are expensive
operations, to be avoided when performance matters. Also, although Mode
X (the undocumented 320x240 256-color VGA mode X-Sharp runs in) doesn't
lend itself well to pixel-oriented operations like line drawing or
texture mapping, the inner loop has been set up to minimize Mode X's
overhead. A rotating plane mask is maintained in AL, with DX pointing to
the Map Mask register; thus, only a rotate and an `OUT` are required
to select the plane to which to write, cycling from plane 0 through
plane 3 and wrapping back to 0. Better yet, because we know that we're
simply stepping horizontally across the destination scan line, we can
use a clever optimization to both step the destination and reduce the
overhead of maintaining the mask. Two copies of the current plane mask
are maintained, one in each nibble of AL. (The Map Mask register pays
attention only to the lower nibble.) Then, when one copy rotates out of
the lower nibble, the other copy rotates into the lower nibble and is
ready to be used. This approach eliminates the need to test for the mask
wrapping from plane 3 to plane 0, all the more so because a carry is
generated when wrapping occurs, and that carry can be added to DI to
advance the screen pointer. (Check out the next chapter, however, to see
the best Map Mask optimization of all—setting it once and leaving it
unchanged.)

In all, the overhead of drawing each pixel is reduced from a call to the
set-pixel routine and full calculation of the screen address and plane
mask to five instructions and no branches. This is an excellent example
of converting full, from-scratch calculations to incremental processing,
whereby only information that has changed since the last operation (the
plane mask moving one pixel, for example) is recalculated.

Incremental processing and knowing where the cycles go are both
important in the final optimization in Listing 57.2, speeding up the
retrieval of pixels from the texture map. This operation looks very
efficient in Listing 57.1, consisting of only two adds and the macro
**GET- IMAGE-PIXEL**. However, those adds are fixed-point adds, so they
take four instructions apiece, and the macro hides not only conversion
from fixed-point to integer, but also a time-consuming multiplication.
Incremental approaches are excellent at avoiding multiplication, because
cumulative additions can often replace multiplication. That's the case
with stepping through the source texture in Listing 57.2; ten
instructions, with a maximum of two branches, replace all the texture
calculations of Listing 57.1. Listing 57.2 simply detects when the
fractional part of the source x or y coordinate turns over and advances
the source texture pointer accordingly.

As you might expect, all this optimization is pretty hard to implement,
and makes Listing 57.2 much more complicated than Listing 57.1. Is it
worth the trouble? Indeed it is. Listing 57.2 is more than twice as fast
as Listing 57.1, and the difference is very noticeable when large,
texture-mapped areas are animated. Whether more than doubling
performance is significant is a matter of opinion, I suppose, but
imagine that you're in William Gibson's *Neuromancer*, trying to crack a
corporate database. Which texture-mapping routine would you rather have
interfacing you to Cyberspace?
