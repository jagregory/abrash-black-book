## Chapter 47 -- Mode X: 256-Color VGA Magic

### Introducing the VGA's Undocumented "Animation-Optimal" Mode

At a book signing for my book *Zen of Code Optimization*, an attractive
young woman came up to me, holding my book, and said, "You're Michael
Abrash, aren't you?" I confessed that I was, prepared to respond in an
appropriately modest yet proud way to the compliments I was sure would
follow. (It was my own book signing, after all.) It didn't work out
quite that way, though. The first thing out of her mouth was:

"‘Mode X' is a stupid name for a graphics mode." As my jaw started to
drop, she added, "And you didn't invent the mode, either. My husband did
it before you did."

And they say there are no groupies in programming!

Well. I never claimed that I invented the mode (which is a 320x256-color
mode with some very special properties, as we'll see shortly). I did
discover it independently, but so did other people in the game business,
some of them no doubt before I did. The difference is that all those
other people held onto this powerful mode as a trade secret, while I
didn't; instead, I spread the word as broadly as I could in my column in
*Dr. Dobb's Journal,* on the theory that the more people knew about this
mode, the more valuable it would be. And I succeeded, as evidenced by
the fact that this now widely-used mode is universally known by the name
I gave it in *DDJ,* "Mode X." Neither do I think that's a bad name; it's
short, catchy, and easy to remember, and it befits the mystery status of
this mode, which was omitted entirely from IBM's documentation of the
VGA.

In fact, when all is said and done, Mode X is one of my favorite
accomplishments. I remember reading that Charles Schultz, creator of
"Peanuts," was particularly proud of having introduced the phrase
"security blanket" to the English language. I feel much the same way
about Mode X; it's now a firmly entrenched part of the computer lexicon,
and how often do any of us get a chance to do that? And that's not to
mention all the excellent games that would not have been as good without
Mode X.

So, in the end, I'm thoroughly pleased with Mode X; the world is a
better place for it, even if it did cost me my one potential female fan.
(Contrary to popular belief, the lives of computer columnists and rock
stars are not, repeat, *not*, all that similar.) This and the following
two chapters are based on the *DDJ* columns that started it all back in
1991, three columns that generated a tremendous amount of interest and
spawned a ton of games, and about which I still regularly get letters
and e-mail. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...Mode X.

### What Makes Mode X Special?

Consider the strange case of the VGA's 320x256-color mode—Mode X—which
is undeniably complex to program and isn't even documented by IBM—but
which is, nonetheless, perhaps the single best mode the VGA has to
offer, especially for animation.

We've seen the VGA's undocumented 256-color modes, in Chapters 31 and
32, but now it's time to delve into the wonders of Mode X itself. (Most
of the performance tips I'll discuss for this mode also apply to the
other non-standard 256-color modes, however.) Five features set Mode X
apart from other VGA modes. First, it has a 1:1 aspect ratio, resulting
in equal pixel spacing horizontally and vertically (that is, square
pixels). Square pixels make for the most attractive displays, and avoid
considerable programming effort that would otherwise be necessary to
adjust graphics primitives and images to match the screen's pixel
spacing. (For example, with square pixels, a circle can be drawn as a
circle; otherwise, it must be drawn as an ellipse that corrects for the
aspect ratio—a slower and considerably more complicated process.) In
contrast, mode 13H, the only documented 256-color mode, provides a
nonsquare 320x200 resolution.

Second, Mode X allows page flipping, a prerequisite for the smoothest
possible animation. Mode 13H does not allow page flipping, nor does mode
12H, the VGA's high-resolution 640x480 16-color mode.

Third, Mode X allows the VGA's plane-oriented hardware to be used to
process pixels in parallel, improving performance by up to four times
over mode 13H.

Fourth, like mode 13H but unlike all other VGA modes, Mode X is a
byte-per-pixel mode (each pixel is controlled by one byte in display
memory), eliminating the slow read-before-write and bit-masking
operations often required in 16-color modes, where each byte of display
memory represents more than a single pixel. In addition to cutting the
number of memory accesses in half, this is important because the
486/Pentium write FIFO and the memory caching schemes used by many VGA
clones speed up writes more than reads.

Fifth, unlike mode 13H, Mode X has plenty of offscreen memory free for
image storage. This is particularly effective in conjunction with the
use of the VGA's latches; together, the latches and the off-screen
memory allow images to be copied to the screen four pixels at a time.

There's a sixth feature of Mode X that's *not* so terrific: It's hard to
program efficiently. As Chapters 23 through 30 of this book
demonstrates, 16-color VGA programming can be demanding. Mode X is often
as demanding as 16-color programming, and operates by a set of rules
that turns everything you've learned in 16-color mode sideways.
Programming Mode X is nothing like programming the nice, flat bitmap of
mode 13H, or, for that matter, the flat, linear (albeit banked) bitmap
used by 256-color SuperVGA modes. (I't's important to remember that Mode
X works on *all* VGAs, not just SuperVGAs.) Many programmers I talk to
love the flat bitmap model, and think that it's the ideal organization
for display memory because it's so straightforward to program. Here,
however, the complexity of Mode X is opportunity—opportunity for the
best combination of performance and appearance the VGA has to offer. If
you do 256-color programming, and especially if you use animation,
you're missing the boat if you're not using Mode X.

Although some developers have taken advantage of Mode X, its use is
certainly not universal, being entirely undocumented; only an
experienced VGA programmer would have the slightest inkling that it even
exists, and figuring out how to make it perform beyond the write
pixel/read pixel level is no mean feat. Little other than my *DDJ*
columns has been published about it, although John Bridges has widely
distributed his code for a number of undocumented 256-color resolutions,
and I'd like to acknowledge the influence of his code on the mode set
routine presented in this chapter.

Given the tremendous advantages of Mode X over the documented mode 13H,
I'd very much like to get it into the hands of as many developers as
possible, so I'm going to spend the next few chapters exploring this odd
but worthy mode. I'll provide mode set code, delineate the bitmap
organization, and show how the basic write pixel and read pixel
operations work. Then, I'll move on to the magic stuff: rectangle fills,
screen clears, scrolls, image copies, pixel inversion, and, yes, polygon
fills (just a different driver for the polygon code), all blurry fast;
hardware raster ops; and page flipping. In the end, I'll build a working
animation program that shows many of the features of Mode X in action.

The mode set code is the logical place to begin.

### Selecting 320x240 256-Color Mode

We could, if we wished, write our own mode set code for Mode X from
scratch—but why bother? Instead, we'll let the BIOS do most of the work
by having it set up mode 13H, which we'll then turn into Mode X by
changing a few registers. Listing 47.1 does exactly that.

The code in Listing 47.1 has been around for some time, and the very
first version had a bug that serves up an interesting lesson. The
original *DDJ* version made images roll on IBM's fixed-frequency VGA
monitors, a problem that didn't come to my attention until the code was
in print and shipped to 100,000 readers.

The bug came about this way: The code I modified to make the Mode X mode
set code used the VGA's 28-MHz clock. Mode X should have used the 25-MHz
clock, a simple matter of setting bit 2 of the Miscellaneous Output
register (3C2H) to 0 instead of 1.

Alas, I neglected to change that single bit, so frames were drawn at a
faster rate than they should have been; however, both of my monitors are
multifrequency types, and they automatically compensated for the faster
frame rate. Consequently, my clock-selection bug was invisible and
innocuous—until it was distributed broadly and everybody started banging
on it.

IBM makes only fixed-frequency VGA monitors, which require very specific
frame rates; if they don't get what you've told them to expect, the
image rolls. The corrected version is the one shown here as Listing
47.1; it does select the 25-MHz clock, and works just fine on
fixed-frequency monitors.

Why didn't I catch this bug? Neither I nor a single one of my testers
had a fixed-frequency monitor! This nicely illustrates how difficult it
is these days to test code in all the PC-compatible environments in
which it might run. The problem is particularly severe for small
developers, who can't afford to buy every model of every hardware
component from every manufacturer; just imagine trying to test
network-aware software in all possible configurations!

When people ask why software isn't bulletproof; why it crashes or
doesn't coexist with certain programs; why PC clones aren't always
compatible; why, in short, the myriad irritations of using a PC
exist—this is a big part of the reason. I guess that's just the price we
pay for the unfettered creativity and vast choice of the PC market.

After setting up mode 13H, Listing 47.1 alters the vertical counts and
timings to select 480 visible scan lines. (There's no need to alter any
horizontal values, because mode 13H and Mode X both have 320-pixel
horizontal resolutions.) The Maximum Scan Line register is programmed to
double scan each line (that is, repeat each scan line twice), however,
so we get an effective vertical resolution of 240 scan lines. It is, in
fact, possible to get 400 or 480 independent scan lines in 256-color
mode, as discussed in Chapter 31 and 32; however, 400-scan-line modes
lack square pixels and can't support simultaneous off-screen memory and
page flipping. Furthermore, 480-scan-line modes lack page flipping
altogether, due to memory constraints.

At the same time, Listing 47.1 programs the VGA's bitmap to a planar
organization that is similar to that used by the 16-color modes, and
utterly different from the linear bitmap of mode 13H. The bizarre bitmap
organization of Mode X is shown in Figure 47.1. The first pixel (the
pixel at the upper left corner of the screen) is controlled by the byte
at offset 0 in plane 0. (The one thing that Mode X blessedly has in
common with mode 13H is that each pixel is controlled by a single byte,
eliminating the need to mask out individual bits of display memory.) The
second pixel, immediately to the right of the first pixel, is controlled
by the byte at offset 0 in plane 1. The third pixel comes from offset 0
in plane 2, and the fourth pixel from offset 0 in plane 3. Then, the
fifth pixel is controlled by the byte at offset 1 in plane 0, and that
cycle continues, with each group of four pixels spread across the four
planes at the same address. The offset M of pixel N in display memory is
M = N/4, and the plane P of pixel N is P = N mod 4. For display memory
writes, the plane is selected by setting bit P of the Map Mask register
(Sequence Controller register 2) to 1 and all other bits to 0; for
display memory reads, the plane is selected by setting the Read Map
register (Graphics Controller register 4) to P.

It goes without saying that this is one ugly bitmap organization,
requiring a lot of overhead to manipulate a single pixel. The write
pixel code shown in Listing 47.2 must determine the appropriate plane
and perform a 16-bit `OUT` to select that plane for each pixel
written, and likewise for the read pixel code shown in Listing 47.3.
Calculating and mapping in a plane once for each pixel written is
scarcely a recipe for performance.

That's all right, though, because most graphics software spends little
time drawing individual pixels. I've provided the write and read pixel
routines as basic primitives, and so you'll understand how the bitmap is
organized, but the building blocks of high-performance graphics software
are fills, copies, and bitblts, and it's there that Mode X shines.

### Designing from a Mode X Perspective

Listing 47.4 shows Mode X rectangle fill code. The plane is selected for
each pixel in turn, with drawing cycling from plane 0 to plane 3, then
wrapping back to plane 0. This is the sort of code that stems from a
write-pixel line of thinking; it reflects not a whit of the unique
perspective that Mode X demands, and although it looks reasonably
efficient, it is in fact some of the slowest graphics code you will ever
see. I've provided Listing 47.4 partly for illustrative purposes, but
mostly so we'll have a point of reference for the substantial speed-up
that's possible with code that's designed from a Mode X perspective.

The two major weaknesses of Listing 47.4 both result from selecting the
plane on a pixel by pixel basis. First, endless `OUT`s (which are
particularly slow on 386s, 486s, and Pentiums, much slower than accesses
to display memory) must be performed, and, second, `REP STOS` can't be
used. Listing 47.5 overcomes both these problems by tailoring the fill
technique to the organization of display memory. Each plane is filled in
its entirety in one burst before the next plane is processed, so only
five `OUT`s are required in all, and `REP STOS` can indeed be used;
I've used `REP STOSB` in Listings 47.5 and 47.6. `REP STOSW` could
be used and would improve performance on most VGAs; however, `REP
STOSW` requires extra overhead to set up, so it can be slower for small
rectangles, especially on 8-bit VGAs. Note that doing an entire plane at
a time can produce a "fading-in" effect for large images, because all
columns for one plane are drawn before any columns for the next. If this
is a problem, the four planes can be cycled through once for each scan
line, rather than once for the entire rectangle.

Listing 47.5 is 2.5 times faster than Listing 47.4 at clearing the
screen on a 20-MHz cached 386 with a Paradise VGA. Although Listing 47.5
is slightly slower than an equivalent mode 13H fill routine would be,
it's not grievously so.

### Hardware Assist from an Unexpected Quarter

Listing 47.5 illustrates the benefits of designing code from a Mode X
perspective; this is the software aspect of Mode X optimization, which
suffices to make Mode X about as fast as mode 13H. That alone makes Mode
X an attractive mode, given its square pixels, page flipping, and
offscreen memory, but superior performance would nonetheless be a
pleasant addition to that list. Superior performance is indeed possible
in Mode X, although, oddly enough, it comes courtesy of the VGA's
hardware, which was never designed to be used in 256-color modes.

All of the VGA's hardware assist features are available in Mode X,
although some are not particularly useful. The VGA hardware feature
that's truly the key to Mode X performance is the ability to process
four planes' worth of data in parallel; this includes both the latches
and the capability to fan data out to any or all planes. For rectangular
fills, we'll just need to fan the data out to various planes, so I'll
defer a discussion of other hardware features for now. (By the way, the
ALUs, bit mask, and most other VGA hardware features are also available
in mode 13H—but parallel data processing is not.)

In planar modes, such as Mode X, a byte written by the CPU to display
memory may actually go to anywhere between zero and four planes, as
shown in Figure 47.2. Each plane for which the setting of the
corresponding bit in the Map Mask register is 1 receives the CPU data,
and each plane for which the corresponding bit is 0 is not modified.

In 16-color modes, each plane contains one-quarter of each of eight
pixels, with the 4 bits of each pixel spanning all four planes. Not so
in Mode X. Look at Figure 47.1 again; each plane contains one pixel in
its entirety, with four pixels at any given address, one per plane.
Still, the Map Mask register does the same job in Mode X as in 16-color
modes; set it to 0FH (all 1-bits), and all four planes will be written
to by each CPU access. Thus, it would seem that up to four pixels could
be set by a single Mode X byte-sized write to display memory,
potentially speeding up operations like rectangle fills by four times.

![**Figure 47.2**  *Selecting planes with the Map Mask register.*](../images/47-02.jpg)

And, as it turns out, four-plane parallelism works quite nicely indeed.
Listing 47.6 is yet another rectangle-fill routine, this time using the
Map Mask to set up to four pixels per `STOS`. The only trick to
Listing 47.6 is that any left or right edge that isn't aligned to a
multiple-of-four pixel column (that is, a column at which one four-pixel
set ends and the next begins) must be clipped via the Map Mask register,
because not all pixels at the address containing the edge are modified.
Performance is as expected; Listing 47.6 is nearly ten times faster at
clearing the screen than Listing 47.4 and just about four times faster
than Listing 47.5—and also about four times faster than the same
rectangle fill in mode 13H. Understanding the bitmap organization and
display hardware of Mode X does indeed pay.

Note that the return from Mode X's parallelism is not always 4x; some
adapters lack the underlying memory bandwidth to write data that fast.
However, Mode X parallel access should always be faster than mode 13H
access; the only question on any given adapter is how *much* faster.

Just so you can see Mode X in action, Listing 47.7 is a sample program
that selects Mode X and draws a number of rectangles. Listing 47.7 links
to any of the rectangle fill routines I've presented.

And now, I hope, you're beginning to see why I'm so fond of Mode X. In
the next chapter, we'll continue with Mode X by exploring the wonders
that the latches and parallel plane hardware can work on scrolls,
copies, blits, and pattern fills.

**LISTING 47.7 L47-7.C**

```c
/* Program to demonstrate mode X (320x240, 256-colors) rectangle
   fill by drawing adjacent 20x20 rectangles in successive colors from
   0 on up across and down the screen */
#include <conio.h>
#include <dos.h>

void Set320x240Mode(void);
void FillRectangleX(int, int, int, int, unsigned int, int);

void main() {
   int i,j;
   union REGS regset;

   Set320x240Mode();
   FillRectangleX(0,0,320,240,0,0); /* clear the screen to black */
   for (j = 1; j < 220; j += 21) {
      for (i = 1; i < 300; i += 21) {
         FillRectangleX(i, j, i+20, j+20, 0, ((j/21*15)+i/21) & 0xFF);
      }
   }
   getch();
   regset.x.ax = 0x0003;   /* switch back to text mode and done */
   int86(0x10, &regset, &regset);
}
```
