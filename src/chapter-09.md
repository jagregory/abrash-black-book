## Chapter 9 -- Hints My Readers Gave Me

### Optimization Odds and Ends from the Field

Back in high school, I took a pre-calculus class from Mr. Bourgeis,
whose most notable characteristics were incessant pacing and truly
enormous feet. My friend Barry, who sat in the back row, right behind
me, claimed that it was because of his large feet that Mr. Bourgeis was
so restless. Those feet were *so* heavy, Barry hypothesized, that if Mr.
Bourgeis remained in any one place for too long, the floor would give
way under the strain, plunging the unfortunate teacher deep into the
mantle of the Earth and possibly all the way through to China. Many
amusing cartoons were drawn to this effect.

Unfortunately, Barry was too busy drawing cartoons, or, alternatively,
sleeping, to actually learn any math. In the long run, that didn't turn
out to be a handicap for Barry, who went on to become vice-president of
sales for a ham-packing company, where presumably he was rarely called
upon to derive the quadratic equation. Barry's lack of scholarship
caused some problems back then, though. On one memorable occasion, Barry
was half-asleep, with his eyes open but unfocused and his chin balanced
on his hand in the classic "if I fall asleep my head will fall off my
hand and I'll wake up" posture, when Mr. Bourgeis popped a killer
problem:

"Barry, solve this for X, please." On the blackboard lay the equation:

    X - 1 = 0

"Minus 1," Barry said promptly.

Mr. Bourgeis shook his head mournfully. "Try again." Barry thought hard.
He knew the fundamental rule that the answer to most mathematical
questions is either 0, 1, infinity, -1, or minus infinity (do not apply
this rule to balancing your checkbook, however); unfortunately, that
gave him only a 25 percent chance of guessing right.

"One," I whispered surreptitiously.

"Zero," Barry announced. Mr. Bourgeis shook his head even more sadly.

"One," I whispered louder. Barry looked still more thoughtful—a bad
sign—so I whispered "one" again, even louder. Barry looked so thoughtful
that his eyes nearly rolled up into his head, and I realized that he was
just doing his best to convince Mr. Bourgeis that Barry had solved this
one by himself.

As Barry neared the climax of his stirring performance and opened his
mouth to speak, Mr. Bourgeis looked at him with great concern. "Barry,
can you hear me all right?"

"Yes, sir," Barry replied. "Why?"

"Well, I could hear the answer all the way up here. Surely you could
hear it just one row away?"

The class went wild. They might as well have sent us home early for all
we accomplished the rest of the day.

I like to think I know more about performance programming than Barry
knew about math. Nonetheless, I always welcome good ideas and comments,
and many readers have sent me a slew of those over the years. So in this
chapter, I think I'll return the favor by devoting a chapter to reader
feedback.

#### Another Look at LEA

Several people have pointed out that while `LEA` is great for
performing certain additions (see Chapter 6), it isn't a perfect
replacement for `ADD`. What's the difference? `LEA`, an addressing
instruction by trade, doesn't affect the flags, while the arithmetic
`ADD` instruction most certainly does. This is no problem when
performing additions that involve only quantities that fit in one
machine word (32 bits in 386 protected mode, 16 bits otherwise), but it
renders `LEA` useless for multiword operations, which use the Carry
flag to tie together partial results. For example, these instructions

```nasm
ADD  EAX,EBX
ADC  EDX,ECX
```

could *not* be replaced

```nasm
LEA  EAX,[EAX+EBX]
ADC  EDX,ECX
```

because `LEA` doesn't affect the Carry flag.

The no-carry characteristic of `LEA` becomes a distinct advantage when
performing pointer arithmetic, however. For instance, the following code
uses `LEA` to advance the pointers while adding one 128-bit memory
variable to another such variable:

```nasm
   MOV   ECX,4   ;# of 32-bit words to add
   CLC
;no carry into the initial ADC
ADDLOOP:

   MOV   EAX,[ESI]    ;get the next element of one array
   ADC   [EDI],EAX    ;add it to the other array, with carry
   LEA   ESI,[ESI+4]  ;advance one array's pointer
   LEA   EDI,[EDI+4]  ;advance the other array's pointer
         LOOP ADDLOOP
```

(Yes, I could use `LODSD` instead of `MOV/LEA`; I'm just
illustrating a point here. Besides, `LODS` is only 1 cycle faster than
`MOV/LEA` on the 386, and is actually more than twice as slow on the
486.) If we used `ADD` rather than `LEA` to advance the pointers,
the carry from one `ADC` to the next would have to be preserved with
either `PUSHF/POPF` or `LAHF/SAHF`. (Alternatively, we could use
multiple `INC`s, since `INC` doesn't affect the Carry flag.)

In short, `LEA` is indeed different from `ADD`. Sometimes it's
better. Sometimes not; that's the nature of the various instruction
substitutions and optimizations that will occur to you over time.
There's no such thing as "best" instructions on the x86; it all depends
on what you're trying to do.

But there sure are a lot of interesting options, aren't there?

#### The Kennedy Portfolio

Reader John Kennedy regularly passes along intriguing assembly
programming tricks, many of which I've never seen mentioned anywhere
else. John likes to optimize for size, whereas I lean more toward speed,
but many of his optimizations are good for both purposes. Here are a few
of my favorites:

John's code for setting AX to its absolute value is:

```nasm
CWD
XOR   AX,DX
SUB   AX,DX
```

This does nothing when bit 15 of AX is 0 (that is, if AX is positive).
When AX is negative, the code "nots" it and adds 1, which is exactly how
you perform a two's complement negate. For the case where AX is not
negative, this trick usually beats the stuffing out of the standard
absolute value code:

```nasm
   AND   AX,AX        ;negative?
   JNS   IsPositive   ;no
   NEG   AX           ;yes,negate it
IsPositive:
```

However, John's code is slower on a 486; as you're no doubt coming to
realize (and as I'll explain in Chapters 12 and 13), the 486 is an
optimization world unto itself.

Here's how John copies a block of bytes from DS:SI to ES:DI, moving as
much data as possible a word at a time:

```nasm
SHR   CX,1      ;word count
REP   MOVSW     ;copy as many words as possible
ADC   CX,CX     ;CX=1 if copy length was odd,
                ;0 else
REP   MOVSB     ;copy any odd byte
```

(`ADC CX,CX` can be replaced with `RCL CX,1`; which is faster
depends on the processor type.) It might be hard to believe that the
above is faster than this:

```nasm
   SHR   CX,1      ;word count
   REP   MOVSW     ;copy as many words as
                   ;possible
   JNC   CopyDone  ;done if even copy length
   MOVSB           ;copy the odd byte
CopyDone:
```

However, it generally is. Sure, if the length is odd, John's approach
incurs a penalty approximately equal to the `REP` startup time for
`MOVSB`. However, if the length is even, John's approach doesn't
branch, saving cycles and not emptying the prefetch queue. If copy
lengths are evenly distributed between even and odd, John's approach is
faster in most x86 systems. (Not on the 486, though.)

John also points out that on the 386, multiple `LEA`s can be combined
to perform multiplications that can't be handled by a single `LEA`,
much as multiple shifts and adds can be used for multiplication, only
faster. `LEA` can be used to multiply in a single instruction on the
386, but only by the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9; several `LEA`s
strung together can handle a much wider range of values. For example,
video programmers are undoubtedly familiar with the following code to
multiply AX times 80 (the width in bytes of the bitmap in most PC
display modes):

```nasm
SHL   AX,1        ;*2
SHL   AX,1        ;*4
SHL   AX,1        ;*8
SHL   AX,1        ;*16
MOV   BX,AX
SHL   AX,1        ;*32
SHL   AX,1        ;*64
ADD   AX,BX       ;*80
```

Using `LEA` on the 386, the above could be reduced to

```nasm
LEA   EAX,[EAX*2]     ;*2
LEA   EAX,[EAX*8]     ;*16
LEA   EAX,[EAX+EAX*4] ;*80
```

which still isn't as fast as using a lookup table like

```nasm
MOV   EAX,MultiplesOf80Table[EAX*4]
```

but is close and takes a great deal less space.

Of course, on the 386, the shift and add version could also be reduced
to this considerably more efficient code:

```nasm
SHL   AX,4       ;*16
MOV   BX,AX
SHL   AX,2       ;*64
ADD   AX,BX      ;*80
```

#### Speeding Up Multiplication

That brings us to multiplication, one of the slowest of x86 operations
and one that allows for considerable optimization. One way to speed up
multiplication is to use shift and add, `LEA`, or a lookup table to
hard-code a multiplication operation for a fixed multiplier, as shown
above. Another is to take advantage of the early-out feature of the 386
(and the 486, but in the interests of brevity I'll just say "386" from
now on) by arranging your operands so that the multiplier (always the
rightmost operand following `MUL` or `IMUL`) is no larger than the
other operand.

> ![](../images/i.jpg)
> Why? Because the 386 processes one multiplier bit per cycle and

> multiplier have been processed, so fewer cycles are required to multiply
> a large multiplicand times a small multiplier than a small multiplicand
> times a large multiplier, by a factor of about 1 cycle for each
> significant multiplier bit eliminated.

(There's a minimum execution time on this trick; below 3 significant
multiplier bits, no additional cycles are saved.) For example,
multiplication of 32,767 times 1 is 12 cycles faster than multiplication
of 1 times 32,727.

Choosing the right operand as the multiplier can work wonders. According
to published specs, the 386 takes 38 cycles to multiply by a multiplier
with 32 significant bits but only 9 cycles to multiply by a multiplier
of 2, a performance improvement of more than four times! (My tests
regularly indicate that multiplication takes 3 to 4 cycles longer than
the specs indicate, but the cycle-per-bit advantage of smaller
multipliers holds true nonetheless.)

This highlights another interesting point: `MUL` and `IMUL` on the
386 are so fast that alternative multiplication approaches, while
generally still faster, are worthwhile only in truly time-critical code.

> `IMUL` instructions can approach and in some cases even outperform the
> "optimized" alternatives.

All in all, `MUL` and `IMUL` are reasonable performers on the 386,
no longer to be avoided in most cases—and you can help that along by
arranging your code to make the smaller operand the multiplier whenever
you know which operand is smaller.

That doesn't mean that your code should test and swap operands to make
sure the smaller one is the multiplier; that rarely pays off. I'm
speaking more of the case where you're scaling an array up by a value
that's always in the range of, say, 2 to 10; because the scale value
will always be small and the array elements may have any value, the
scale value is the logical choice for the multiplier.

#### Optimizing Optimized Searching

Rob Williams writes with a wonderful optimization to the `REPNZ
SCASB`-based optimized searching routine I discussed in Chapter 5. As a
quick refresher, I described searching a buffer for a text string as
follows: Scan for the first byte of the text string with `REPNZ
SCASB`, then use `REPZ CMPS` to check for a full match whenever
`REPNZ SCASB` finds a match for the first character, as shown in
Figure 9.1. The principle is that most buffer characters won't match the
first character of any given string, so `REPNZ SCASB`, by far the
fastest way to search on the PC, can be used to eliminate most potential
matches; each remaining potential match can then be checked in its
entirety with `REPZ CMPS`.

![**Figure 9.1**  *Simple searching method for locating a text string.*](../images/09-01.jpg)

Rob's revelation, which he credits without explanation to Edgar Allen
Poe (search nevermore?), was that by far the slowest part of the whole
deal is handling `REPNZ SCASB` matches, which require checking the
remainder of the string with `REPZ CMPS` and restarting `REPNZ
SCASB` if no match is found.

Imagine, if you will, that you're searching for the string "EQUAL." By
my approach, you'd use `REPNZ SCASB` to scan for each occurrence of
"E," which crops up quite often in normal text. Rob points out that it
would make more sense to scan for "Q," then back up one character and
check the whole string when a "Q" is found, as shown in Figure 9.2. "Q"
is likely to occur much less often, resulting in many fewer whole-string
checks and much faster processing.

Listing 9.1 implements the scan-on-first-character approach. Listing 9.2
scans for whatever character the caller specifies. Listing 9.3 is a test
program used to compare the two approaches. How much difference does
Rob's revelation make? Plenty. Even when the entire C function call to
`FindString` is timed—`strlen` calls, parameter pushing, calling,
setup, and all—the version of `FindString` in Listing 9.2, which is
directed by Listing 9.3 to scan for the infrequently-occurring "Q," is
about 40 percent faster on a 20 MHz cached 386 for the test search of
Listing 9.3 than is the version of `FindString` in Listing 9.1, which
always scans for the first character, in this case "E." However, when
only the search loops (the code that actually does the searching) in the
two versions of `FindString` are compared, Listing 9.2 is more than
*twice* as fast as Listing 9.1—a remarkable improvement over code that
already uses `REPNZ SCASB` and `REPZ CMPS`.

What I like so much about Rob's approach is that it demonstrates that
optimization involves much more than instruction selection and cycle
counting. Listings 9.1 and 9.2 use pretty much the same instructions,
and even use the same approach of scanning with `REPNZ SCASB` and
using `REPZ CMPS` to check scanning matches.

You'll notice that in Listing 9.2 I didn't use a table of character
frequencies in English text to determine the character for which to
scan, but rather let the caller make that choice. Each buffer of bytes
has unique characteristics, and English-letter frequency could well be
inappropriate. What if the buffer is filled with French text? Cyrillic?
What if it isn't text that's being searched? It might be worthwhile for
an application to build a dynamic frequency table for each buffer so
that the best scan character could be chosen for each search. Or perhaps
not, if the search isn't time-critical or the buffer is small.

The point is that you can improve performance dramatically by
understanding the nature of the data with which you work. (This is
equally true for high-level language programming, by the way.) Listing
9.2 is very similar to and only slightly more complex than Listing 9.1;
the difference lies not in elbow grease or cycle counting but in the
organic integrating optimizer technology we all carry around in our
heads.

#### Short Sorts

David Stafford (recently of Borland and Borland Japan) who happens to be
one of the best assembly language programmers I've ever met, has written
a C-callable routine that sorts an array of integers in ascending order.
That wouldn't be particularly noteworthy, except that David's routine,
shown in Listing 9.4, is exactly *25 bytes* long. Look at the code;
you'll keep saying to yourself, "But this doesn't work...oh, yes, I
guess it does." As they say in the Prego spaghetti sauce ads, *it's in
there*—and what a job of packing. Anyway, David says that a 24-byte sort
routine eludes him, and he'd like to know if anyone can come up with
one.

#### Full 32-Bit Division

One of the most annoying limitations of the x86 is that while the
dividend operand to the `DIV` instruction can be 32 bits in size, both
the divisor and the result must be 16 bits. That's particularly annoying
in regards to the result because sometimes you just don't know whether
the ratio of the dividend to the divisor is greater than 64K-1 or
not—and if you guess wrong, you get that godawful Divide By Zero
interrupt. So, what is one to do when the result might not fit in 16
bits, or when the dividend is larger than 32 bits? Fall back to a
software division approach? That will work—but oh so slowly.

There's another technique that's much faster than a pure software
approach, albeit not so flexible. This technique allows arbitrarily
large dividends and results, but the divisor is still limited to16 bits.
That's not perfect, but it does solve a number of problems, in
particular eliminating the possibility of a Divide By Zero interrupt
from a too-large result.

This technique involves nothing more complicated than breaking up the
division into word-sized chunks, starting with the most significant word
of the dividend. The most significant word is divided by the divisor
(with no chance of overflow because there are only 16 bits in each);
then the remainder is prepended to the next 16 bits of dividend, and the
process is repeated, as shown in Figure 9.3. This process is equivalent
to dividing by hand, except that here we stop to carry the remainder
manually only after each word of the dividend; the hardware divide takes
care of the rest. Listing 9.5 shows a function to divide an arbitrarily
large dividend by a 16-bit divisor, and Listing 9.6 shows a sample
division of a large dividend. Note that the same principle can be
applied to handling arbitrarily large dividends in 386 native mode code,
but in that case the operation can proceed a dword, rather than a word,
at a time.

![**Figure 9.3**  *Fast multiword division on the 386.*](../images/09-03.jpg)

As for handling signed division with arbitrarily large dividends, that
can be done easily enough by remembering the signs of the dividend and
divisor, dividing the absolute value of the dividend by the absolute
value of the divisor, and applying the stored signs to set the proper
signs for the quotient and remainder. There may be more clever ways to
produce the same result, by using `IDIV`, for example; if you know of
one, drop me a line c/o Coriolis Group Books.

#### Sweet Spot Revisited

Way back in Volume 1, Number 1 of *PC TECHNIQUES*, (April/May 1990) I
wrote the very first of that magazine's HAX (\#1), which extolled the
virtues of placing your most commonly-used automatic (stack-based)
variables within the stack's "sweet spot," the area between +127 to -128
bytes away from BP, the stack frame pointer. The reason was that the
8088 can store addressing displacements that fall within that range in a
single byte; larger displacements require a full word of storage,
increasing code size by a byte per instruction, and thereby slowing down
performance due to increased instruction fetching time.

This takes on new prominence in 386 native mode, where straying from the
sweet spot costs not one, but two or three bytes. Where the 8088 had two
possible displacement sizes, either byte or word, on the 386 there are
three possible sizes: byte, word, or dword. In native mode (32-bit
protected mode), however, a prefix byte is needed in order to use a
word-sized displacement, so a variable located outside the sweet spot
requires either two extra bytes (an extra displacement byte plus a
prefix byte) or three extra bytes (a dword displacement rather than a
byte displacement). Either way, instructions grow alarmingly.

Performance may or may not suffer from missing the sweet spot, depending
on the processor, the memory architecture, and the code mix. On a 486,
prefix bytes often cost a cycle; on a 386SX, increased code size often
slows performance because instructions must be fetched through the
half-pint 16-bit bus; on a 386, the effect depends on the instruction
mix and whether there's a cache.

> On balance, though, it's as important to keep your most-used variables

In assembly, it's easy to control the organization of your stack frame.
In C, however, you'll have to figure out the allocation scheme your
compiler uses to allocate automatic variables, and declare automatics
appropriately to produce the desired effect. It can be done: I did it in
Turbo C some years back, and trimmed the size of a program (admittedly,
a large one) by several K—not bad, when you consider that the "sweet
spot" optimization is essentially free, with no code reorganization,
change in logic, or heavy thinking involved.

#### Hard-Core Cycle Counting

Next, we come to an item that cycle counters will love, especially since
it involves apparently incorrect documentation on Intel's part.
According to Intel's documents, all `RCR` and `RCL` instructions,
which perform rotations through the Carry flag, as shown in Figure 9.4,
take 9 cycles on the 386 when working with a register operand. My
measurements indicate that the 9-cycle execution time almost holds true
for *multibit* rotate-through-carries, which I've timed at 8 cycles
apiece; for example, `RCR AX,CL` takes 8 cycles on *my* 386, as does
`RCL DX,2`. Contrast that with `ROR` and `ROL`, which can rotate
the contents of a register any number of bits in just 3 cycles.

However, rotating by one bit through the Carry flag does *not* take 9
cycles, contrary to Intel's *80386 Programmer's Reference Manual*, or
even 8 cycles. In fact, `RCR` *reg*,1 and `RCL` *reg*,1 take 3
cycles, just like `ROR`, `ROL`, `SHR`, and `SHL`. At least, that's how
fast they run on my 386, and I very much doubt that you'll find
different execution times on other 386s. (Please let me know if you do,
though!)

![**Figure 9.4**  *Performing rotate instructions using the Carry flag.*](../images/09-04.jpg)

Interestingly, according to Intel's *i486 Microprocessor Programmer's
Reference Manual*, the 486 can `RCR` or `RCL` a register by one bit
in 3 cycles, but takes between 8 and 30 cycles to perform a multibit
register `RCR` or `RCL`!

No great lesson here, just a caution to be leery of multibit `RCR` and
`RCL` when performance matters—and to take cycle-time documentation
with a grain of salt.

#### Hardwired Far Jumps

Did you ever wonder how to code a far jump to an absolute address in
assembly language? Probably not, but if you ever do, you're going to be
glad for this next item, because the obvious solution doesn't work. You
might think all it would take to jump to, say, 1000:5 would be `JMP FAR
PTR 1000:5`, but you'd be wrong. That won't even assemble. You might
then think to construct in memory a far pointer containing 1000:5, as in
the following:

```nasm
Ptr  dd   ?
     :
     mov  word ptr [Ptr],5
     mov  word ptr [Ptr+2],1000h
     jmp  [Ptr]
```

That will work, but at a price in performance. On an 8088, `JMP DWORD
PTR [*mem*]` (an indirect far jump) takes at least 37 cycles; `JMP
DWORD PTR *label*` (a direct far jump) takes only 15 cycles (plus,
almost certainly, some cycles for instruction fetching). On a 386, an
indirect far jump is documented to take at least 43 cycles in real mode
(31 in protected mode); a direct far jump is documented to take at least
12 cycles, about three times faster. In truth, the difference between
those two is nowhere near that big; the fastest I've measured for a
direct far jump is 21 cycles, and I've measured indirect far jumps as
fast as 30 cycles, so direct is still faster, but not by so much. (Oh,
those cycle-time documentation blues!) Also, a direct far jump is
documented to take at least 27 cycles in protected mode; why the big
difference in protected mode, I have no idea.

At any rate, to return to our original problem of jumping to 1000:5:
Although an indirect far jump will work, a direct far jump is still
preferable.

Listing 9.7 shows a short program that performs a direct far call to
1000:5. (Don't run it, unless you want to crash your system!) It does
this by creating a dummy segment at 1000H, so that the label
`FarLabel` can be created with the desired far attribute at the proper
location. (Segments created with "AT" don't cause the generation of any
actual bytes or the allocation of any memory; they're just templates.)
It's a little kludgey, but at least it does work. There may be a better
solution; if you have one, pass it along.

**LISTING 9.7 L9-7.ASM**

```nasm
; Program to perform a direct far jump to address 1000:5.
; *** Do not run this program! It's just an example of how ***
; *** to build a direct far jump to an absolute address    ***
;
; Tested with TASM 2 and MASM 5.

FarSeg     segment  at 01000h

FarSeg      ends

      .model     small
      .code
start:
      jmp     FarLabel
      end     start
```

By the way, if you're wondering how I figured this out, I merely applied
my good friend Dan Illowsky's long-standing rule for dealing with MASM:

If the obvious doesn't work (and it usually doesn't), just try
everything you can think of, no matter how ridiculous, until you find
something that does—a rule with plenty of history on its side.

#### Setting 32-Bit Registers: Time versus Space

To finish up this chapter, consider these two items. First, in 32-bit
protected mode,

```nasm
sub  eax,eax
inc  eax
```

takes 4 cycles to execute, but is only 3 bytes long, while

```nasm
mov  eax,1
```

takes only 2 cycles to execute, but is 5 bytes long (because native mode
constants are dwords and the `MOV` instruction doesn't sign-extend).
Both code fragments are ways to set `EAX` to 1 (although the first
affects the flags and the second doesn't); this is a classic trade-off
of speed for space. Second,

```nasm
or    ebx,-1
```

takes 2 cycles to execute and is 3 bytes long, while

```nasm
move  bx,-1
```

takes 2 cycles to execute and is 5 bytes long. Both instructions set
`EBX` to -1; this is a classic trade-off of—gee, it's not a trade-off
at all, is it? `OR` is a better way to set a 32-bit register to all
1-bits, just as `SUB` or `XOR` is a better way to set a register to
all 0-bits. Who woulda thunk it? Just goes to show how the 32-bit
displacements and constants of 386 native mode change the familiar
landscape of 80x86 optimization.

Be warned, though, that I've found `OR`, `AND`, `ADD`, and the like to be
a cycle slower than `MOV` when working with immediate operands on the
386 under some circumstances, for reasons that thus far escape me. This
just reinforces the first rule of optimization: Measure your code in
action, and place not your trust in documented cycle times.
