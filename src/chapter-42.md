## Chapter 42 -- Wu'ed in Haste; Fried, Stewed at Leisure

### Fast Antialiased Lines Using Wu's Algorithm

The thought first popped into my head as I unenthusiastically picked
through the salad bar at a local "family" restaurant, trying to decide
whether the meatballs, the fried clams, or the lasagna was likely to
shorten my life the least. I decided on the chicken in mystery sauce.

The thought recurred when my daughter asked, "Dad, is that fried
chicken?"

"I don't think so," I said. "I think it's stewed chicken."

"It looks like fried chicken."

"Maybe it's fried, stewed chicken," my wife volunteered hopefully. I
took a bite. It was, indeed, fried, stewed chicken. I can now,
unhesitatingly and without reservation, recommend that you avoid fried,
stewed chicken at all costs.

The thought I had was as follows: *This is not good food*. Not a
profound thought, but it raises an interesting question: Why was I
eating in this restaurant? The answer, to borrow a phrase from E.F.
Schumacher, is *appropriate technology*. For a family on a budget, with
a small child, tired of staring at each other over the kitchen table,
this was a perfect place to eat. It was cheap, it had greasy food and
ice cream, no one cared if children dropped things or talked loudly or
walked around, and, most important of all, it wasn't home. So what if
the food was lousy? Good food was a luxury, a bonus; everything on the
above list was necessary. A family restaurant was the appropriate
dining-out technology, given the parameters within which we had to work.

When I read through SIGGRAPH proceedings and other state-of-the-art
computer-graphics material, all too often I feel like I'm dining at a
four-star restaurant with two-year-old triplets and an empty wallet.
We're talking incredibly inappropriate technology for PC graphics here.
Sure, I say to myself as I read about an antialiasing technique, that
sounds wonderful—if I had 24-bpp color, and dedicated hardware to do the
processing, and all day to wait to generate one image. Yes, I think,
that is a good way to do hidden surface removal—in a system with
hardware z-buffering. Most of the stuff in the journal *Computer
Graphics* is riveting, but, alas, pretty much useless on PCs. When an
x86 has to do all the work, speed becomes the overriding parameter,
especially for real-time graphics.

Literature that's applicable to fast PC graphics is hard enough to find,
but what we'd really like is above-average image quality combined with
terrific speed, and there's almost no literature of that sort around.
There is some, however, and you folks are right on top of it. For
example, alert reader Michael Chaplin, of San Diego, wrote to suggest
that I might enjoy the line-antialiasing algorithm presented in Xiaolin
Wu's article, "An Efficient Antialiasing Technique," in the July 1991
issue of *Computer Graphics*. Michael was dead-on right. This is a great
algorithm, combining excellent antialiased line quality with speed
that's close to that of non-antialiased Bresenham's line drawing. This
is the sort of algorithm that makes you want to go out and write a
wire-frame animation program, just so you can see how good those smooth
lines look in motion. Wu antialiasing is a wonderful example of what can
be accomplished on inexpensive, mass-market hardware with the proper
programming perspective. In short, it's a splendid example of
appropriate technology for PCs.

### Wu Antialiasing

Antialiasing, as we've been discussing for the past few chapters, is the
process of smoothing lines and edges so that they appear less jagged.
Antialiasing is partly an aesthetic issue, because it makes images more
attractive. It's also partly an accuracy issue, because it makes it
possible to position and draw images with effectively more precision
than the resolution of the display. Finally, it's partly a flat-out
necessity, to avoid the horrible, crawling, jagged edges of temporal
aliasing when performing animation.

The basic premise of Wu antialiasing is almost ridiculously simple: As
the algorithm steps one pixel unit at a time along the major (longer)
axis of a line, it draws the two pixels bracketing the line along the
minor axis at each point. Each of the two bracketing pixels is drawn
with a weighted fraction of the full intensity of the drawing color,
with the weighting for each pixel equal to one minus the pixel's
distance along the minor axis from the ideal line. Yes, it's a mouthful,
but Figure 42.1 illustrates the concept.

The intensities of the two pixels that bracket the line are selected so
that they always sum to exactly 1; that is, to the intensity of one
fully illuminated pixel of the drawing color. The presence of aggregate
full-pixel intensity means that at each step, the line has the same
brightness it would have if a single pixel were drawn at precisely the
correct location. Moreover, thanks to the distribution of the intensity
weighting, that brightness is centered at the ideal line. Not
coincidentally, a line drawn with pixel pairs of aggregate single-pixel
intensity, centered on the ideal line, is perceived by the eye not as a
jagged collection of pixel pairs, but as a smooth line centered on the
ideal line. Thus, by weighting the bracketing pixels properly at each
step, we can readily produce what looks like a smooth line at precisely
the right location, rather than the jagged pattern of line segments that
non-antialiased line-drawing algorithms such as Bresenham's (see
Chapters 35, 36, and 37) trace out.

![**Figure 42.1**  *The basic concept of Wu antialiasing.*](../images/42-01.jpg)

You might expect that the implementation of Wu antialiasing would fall
into two distinct areas: tracing out the line (that is, finding the
appropriate pixel pairs to draw) and calculating the appropriate
weightings for each pixel pair. Not so, however. The weighting
calculations involve only a few shifts, XORs, and adds; for all
practical purposes, tracing and weighting are rolled into one step—and a
very fast step it is. How fast is it? On a 33-MHz 486 with a fast VGA, a
good but not maxed-out assembly implementation of Wu antialiasing draws
a more than respectable 5,000 150-pixel-long vectors per second. That's
especially impressive considering that about 1,500,000 actual pixels are
drawn per second, meaning that Wu antialiasing is drawing at around 50
percent of the maximum memory bandwidth—half the fastest theoretically
possible drawing speed—of an AT-bus VGA. In short, Wu antialiasing is
about as fast an antialiased line approach as you could ever hope to
find for the VGA.

### Tracing and Intensity in One

Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines do not require Wu antialiasing
because they pass through the center of every pixel they meet; such
lines can be drawn with fast, special-case code. For all other cases, Wu
lines are traced out one step at a time along the major axis by means of
a simple, fixed-point algorithm. The move along the minor axis with
respect to a one-pixel move along the major axis (the line slope for
lines with slopes less than 1, 1/slope for lines with slopes greater
than 1) is calculated with a single integer divide. This value, called
the "error adjust," is stored as a fixed-point fraction, in 0.16 format
(that is, all bits are fractional, and the decimal point is just to the
left of bit 15). An error accumulator, also in 0.16 format, is
initialized to 0. Then the first pixel is drawn; no weighting is needed,
because the line intersects its endpoints exactly.

Now the error adjust is added to the error accumulator. The error
accumulator indicates how far between pixels the line has progressed
along the minor axis at any given step; when the error accumulator turns
over, it's time to advance one pixel along the minor axis. At each step
along the line, the major-axis coordinate advances by one pixel. The two
bracketing pixels to draw are simply the two pixels nearest the line
along the minor axis. For instance, if X is the current major-axis
coordinate and Y is the current minor-axis coordinate, the two pixels to
be drawn are (X,Y) and (X,Y+1). In short, the derivation of the pixels
at which to draw involves nothing more complicated than advancing one
pixel along the major axis, adding the error adjust to the error
accumulator, and advancing one pixel along the minor axis when the error
accumulator turns over.

So far, nothing special; but now we come to the true wonder of Wu
antialiasing. We know which pair of pixels to draw at each step along
the line, but we also need to generate the two proper intensities, which
must be inversely proportional to distance from the ideal line and sum
to 1, and that's a potentially time-consuming operation. Let's assume,
however, that the number of possible intensity levels to be used for
weighting is the value NumLevels = 2^n^ for some integer n, with the
minimum weighting (0 percent intensity) being the value 2^n^ -1, and the
maximum weighting (100 percent intensity) being the value 0. Given that,
lo and behold, the most significant n bits of the error accumulator
select the proper intensity value for one element of the pixel pair, as
shown in Figure 42.2. Better yet, 2^n^-1 minus the intensity of the
first pixel selects the intensity of the other pixel in the pair,
because the intensities of the two pixels must sum to 1; as it happens,
this result can be obtained simply by flipping the n least-significant
bits of the first pixel's value. All this works because what the error
accumulator accumulates is precisely the ideal line's current distance
between the two bracketing pixels.

![**Figure 42.2**  *Wu intensity calculations.*](../images/42-02.jpg)

The intensity calculations take longer to describe than they do to
perform. All that's involved is a shift of the error accumulator to
right-justify the desired intensity weighting bits, and then an XOR to
flip the least-significant n bits of the first pixel's value in order to
generate the second pixel's value. Listing 42.1 illustrates just how
efficient Wu antialiasing is; the intensity calculations take only three
statements, and the entire Wu line-drawing loop is only nine statements
long. Of course, a single C statement can hide a great deal of
complexity, but Listing 42.6, an assembly implementation, shows that
only 15 instructions are required per step along the major axis—and the
number of instructions could be reduced to ten by special-casing and
loop unrolling. Make no mistake about it, Wu antialiasing is fast.

### Sample Wu Antialiasing

The true test of any antialiasing technique is how good it looks, so
let's have a look at Wu antialiasing in action. Listing 42.1 is a C
implementation of Wu antialiasing. Listing 42.2 is a sample program that
draws a variety of Wu-antialiased lines, followed by non-antialiased
lines, for comparison. Listing 42.3 contains `DrawPixel()` and
`SetMode()` functions for mode 13H, the VGA's 320x200 256-color mode.
Finally, Listing 42.4 is a simple, non-antialiased line-drawing routine.
Link these four listings together and run the resulting program to see
both Wu-antialiased and non-antialiased lines.

Listing 42.1 isn't particularly fast, because it calls `DrawPixel()`
for each pixel. On the other hand, `DrawPixel()` makes it easy to try
out Wu antialiasing in a variety of modes; just adapt the code in
Listing 42.3 for the 256-color mode you want to support. For example,
Listing 42.5 shows code to draw Wu-antialiased lines in 640x480
256-color mode on SuperVGAs built around the Tseng Labs ET4000 chip with
at least 512K of display memory installed. It's well worth checking out
Wu antialiasing at 640x480. Although antialiased lines look much
smoother than normal lines at 320x200 resolution, they're far from
perfect, because the pixels are so big that the eye can't blend them
properly. At 640x480, however, Wu-antialiased lines look fabulous; from
a couple of feet away, they look as straight and smooth as if they were
drawn with a ruler.

Listing 42.1 requires that the DAC palette be set up so that a
`NumLevel`-long block of palette entries contains linearly decreasing
intensities of the drawing color. The size of the block is programmable,
but must be a power of two. The more intensity levels, the better. Wu
says that 32 intensities are enough; on my system, eight and even four
levels looked pretty good. I found that gamma correction, which gives
linearly spaced intensity steps, improved antialiasing quality
significantly. Fortunately, we can program the palette with
gamma-corrected values, so our drawing code doesn't have to do any extra
work.

Listing 42.1 isn't very fast, so I implemented Wu antialiasing in
assembly, hard-coded for mode 13H. The implementation is shown in full
in Listing 42.6. High-speed graphics code and fast VGAs go together like
peanut butter and jelly, which is to say very well indeed; the assembly
implementation ran more than twice as fast as the C code on my 486.
Enough said!

; C near-callable function to draw an antialiased line from
; (X0,Y0) to (X1,Y1), in mode 13h, the VGA's standard 320x200 256-color
; mode. Uses an antialiasing approach published by Xiaolin Wu in the July
; 1991 issue of Computer Graphics. Requires that the palette be set up so
; that there are NumLevels intensity levels of the desired drawing color,
; starting at color BaseColor (100% intensity) and followed by (NumLevels-1)
; levels of evenly decreasing intensity, with color (BaseColor+NumLevels-1)
; being 0% intensity of the desired drawing color (black). No clipping is
; performed in DrawWuLine. Handles a maximum of 256 intensity levels per
; antialiased color. This code is suitable for use at screen resolutions,
; with lines typically no more than 1K long; for longer lines, 32-bit error
; arithmetic must be used to avoid problems with fixed-point inaccuracy.

#### Notes on Wu Antialiasing

Wu antialiasing can be applied to any curve for which it's possible to
calculate at each step the positions and intensities of two bracketing
pixels, although the implementation will generally be nowhere near as
efficient as it is for lines. However, Wu's article in *Computer
Graphics* does describe an efficient algorithm for drawing antialiased
circles. Wu also describes a technique for antialiasing solids, such as
filled circles and polygons. Wu's approach biases the edges of filled
objects outward. Although this is no good for adjacent polygons of the
sort used in rendering, it's certainly possible to design a more
accurate polygon-antialiasing approach around Wu's basic weighting
technique. The results would not be quite so good as more sophisticated
antialiasing techniques, but they would be much faster.

With a 16-bit error accumulator, fixed-point inaccuracy becomes a
problem for Wu-antialiased lines longer than 1K. For such lines, you
should switch to using 32-bit error values, which would let you handle
lines of any practical length.

In the listings, I have chosen to truncate, rather than round, the
error-adjust value. This increases the intensity error of the line but
guarantees that fixed-point inaccuracy won't cause the minor axis to
advance past the endpoint. Overrunning the endpoint would result in the
drawing of pixels outside the line's bounding box, and potentially even
in an attempt to access pixels off the edge of the bitmap.

Finally, I should mention that, as published, Wu's algorithm draws lines
symmetrically, from both ends at once. I haven't done this for a number
of reasons, not least of which is that symmetric drawing is an
inefficient way to draw lines that span banks on banked Super-VGAs.
Banking aside, however, symmetric drawing is potentially faster, because
it eliminates half of all calculations; in so doing, it cuts cumulative
error in half, as well.

With or without symmetrical processing, Wu antialiasing beats fried,
stewed chicken hands-down. Trust me on this one.
