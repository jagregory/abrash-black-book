Listings 41.2 and 41.3 are variants of the fast convex polygon fill code
from Chapter 39, modified to be able to handle all monotone-vertical
polygons, including nonsimple ones; the edge-scanning code (Listing 39.4
from Chapter 39) remains the same, and so is not shown again here.

**LISTING 41.2 L41-2.C**

    /* Color-fills a convex polygon. All vertices are offset by (XOffset, YOffset).
    "Convex" means "monotone with respect to a vertical line"; that is, every 
    horizontal line drawn through the polygon at any point would cross exactly two 
    active edges (neither horizontal lines nor zero-length edges count as active 
    edges; both are acceptable anywhere in the polygon). Right & left edges may 
    cross (polygons may be nonsimple). Polygons that are not convex according to 
    this definition won't be drawn properly. (Yes, "convex" is a lousy name for 
    this type of polygon, but it's convenient; use "monotone-vertical" if it makes 
    you happier!)
    *******************************************************************
    NOTE: the low-level drawing routine, DrawHorizontalLineList, must be able to
    reverse the edges, if necessary to make the correct edge left edge. It must 
    also expect right edge to be specified in +1 format (the X coordinate is 1 past
    highest coordinate to draw). In both respects, this differs from low-level 
    drawing routines presented in earlier columns; changes are necessary to make it
    possible to draw nonsimple monotone-vertical polygons; that in turn makes it 
    possible to use Jim Kent's test for monotone-vertical polygons.
