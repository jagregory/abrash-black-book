Table 16.2 has two times for each entry listed: the first value is the
overall counting time, including time spent in the main program, disk
I/O, and everything else; the second value is the time actually spent
counting words, the time spent in `ScanBuffer` . The first value is
the time perceived by the user, but the second value best reflects the
quality of the optimization in each entry, since the rest of the overall
execution time is fixed.

How it works
——————
The idea is to go through the buffer fetching each letter-pair (words
rather than bytes).  The carry flag indicates whether we are
currently in a (text) word or not.  The letter-pair fetched from the
buffer is converted to a 16-bit address by shifting it left one bit
(losing the high bit of the second character) and putting the carry
flag in the low bit.  The high bit of the count register is set to
1.  Then the count register is added to the byte found at the given
address in a large (64K, naturally) table.  The byte at the given
address will contain a 1 in the high bit if the last character of the
letter-pair is a word-letter (alphanumeric or apostrophe).  This  will
set the carry flag since the high bit of the count register is also a
1. The low bit of the byte found at the given address will be one if
the second character of the previous letter-pair was a word-letter
and the first character of this letter-pair is not a word-letter. It
will also be 1 if the first character of this letter-pair is a
word-letter but the second character is not.  This process is
repeated.  Finally, the carry flag is saved to indicate the final
in-a-word/not-in-a-word status.  The count register is masked to
remove the high bit and the count of words remains in the count
register.
 Sound complicated?  You're right!  But it's fast!
  
The beauty of this method is that no jumps are required, the
operations are fast, it requires only one table and the process can
be repeated (unrolled) many times.  QSCAN3 can read 256 bytes without
jumping.
